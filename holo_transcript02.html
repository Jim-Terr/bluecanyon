                <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In May 10th, 
                  1940, the Germans invaded Holland, Belgium and France on a Friday, 
                  and three days after that on a Monday, May the 13th, 1940 I 
                  came home and told my family, &quot;Let's get the hell outta 
                  here.&quot; And we did. We took a train. We wanted to go to 
                  France. We took a train from Antwerp, Belgium, to Brussels. 
                  We never got to Brussels, really. Because before we got to Brussels 
                  at Schaerbeek they were calling through the microphone, or whatever 
                  they call it. &quot;The refugees from France or Paris get out 
                  of here&quot;. So we did. My wife and my little boy-he was then 
                  7-8 months-my father and mother in law, and three sisters in 
                  law got out and were led to a freight train, very clean with 
                  straw and everything else. And that was the only thing that 
                  we had there. And we were on a trip that took us 5 days. We 
                  were in France, for one place to another because the military 
                  obviously had priority. And we were told that when we arrived 
                  in Valentine Haute Garrone The Haute Garrone was a department 
                  of France. Capital Toulouse. We were in St. Gaudens which was 
                  the Super sous-prefecture as they called it. And we got out 
                  of there in Valentin. Valentin was the birthplace of Marshall 
                  Foch in World War I. Anyway, we got there.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We were 
                  escaping because we were Jewish. We didn't want to get burned 
                  in the gas chamber that's why we escaped. Two months later a 
                  few Arabs, Tunisians, Moroccans, Algerians came to the place 
                  to wait to be repatriated to North Africa. And we were talking 
                  and they told us that there would be a much better life in North 
                  Africa. For two sheep you could get a 14-15 year old wife. I 
                  thought this was a good idea. But then France collapsed. And 
                  I went on the bike from Valentine to Toulouse, which was about 
                  200 kilometers back and forth and I got a passport from the 
                  Dutch consul in Toulouse, giving us an opportunity to leave 
                  Valentin to go to Algeria.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We got to 
                  Algiers. First we went to Porvendre; that's close to the Spanish 
                  border on the Mediterranean. From there we took the boat. The 
                  Governor General came on, and took us to Algiers. In Algiers 
                  we had some French living there-Arabs who gave us their address, 
                  so we thought we were ok there. Then we came to the place where 
                  they were living and they were to the bled (oasis). That's like 
                  living in the country. The guy, his name was Muktar-I'll never 
                  forget that. The guy came up with a taxi. I said to my wife, 
                  &quot;Let's get in it and go to the Dutch Consulate in the Rue 
                  Richelieu In Algiers. Of course, it was after 3:00 o'clock in 
                  the afternoon and the thing was closed, so we went the next 
                  day. I'm showing that there were some good Arabs too.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The next 
                  day we went to the Rue Ricelieu and the guy gave me 100 francs, 
                  because I didn't have that much money. The day after I went 
                  every day to the consulate and the secretary told me one day 
                  that there was another Dutchman that was living there. Oh, good, 
                  send him to my place to the Place Du Government, which was the 
                  hotel. Alright He knocks at the door at 3:00 o'clock in the 
                  afternoon. I opened the door and said &quot;My God what are 
                  you doing here.&quot; It was a friend of mine that I hadn't 
                  seen for years that came to Antwerp at the age of 12. I taught 
                  him to speak French and now here he is. You get a little money 
                  from Monsieur Gotray. He was the Swedish consul who also took 
                  care of all the countries that were occupied by the Germans.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">He said, 
                  &quot;come to Oran&quot;. We went to Oran. I had to go to get 
                  some money for a ticket for the train. I became Catholic and 
                  went to see Cardinal Dozun in Algiers. He gave me 200 francs. 
                  I went to the Protestant Church, they gave me 200 francs. I 
                  went to the Jewish community and I got their 200 francs. So 
                  I got enough money for one ticket. My wife and my child had 
                  to be on it. So I got the wrong ticket, as we called it. Take 
                  somebody to the train to get a ticket and you have to give that 
                  back when you go out. So that was the idea. Any time the conductor 
                  came into the train to Oran I disappeared. But we got there. 
                  People waiting for me, a number of friends. Oran is in North 
                  Africa. We've got Algiers, Oran, that's Algeria. On the other 
                  side is Tunisia. On the other side is Morrocco. My son was born 
                  in Oran. He's now a professor at the University of Salt Lake 
                  City. I wrote a story about that, the one I gave you.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A few months 
                  after that, I had a feeling to leave. I had premonitions. Feelings 
                  of &quot;do this,&quot; the same way we left Antwerp to go to 
                  France. This time there was a feeling of &quot;Let's get the 
                  hell out of Oran.&quot; The day after we left, all of the foreigners 
                  in Orran were picked up by the French Vichy with the Gestapo 
                  behind them and were sent to the Trans Orient (railroad)-the 
                  real road through the Sahara.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We went 
                  to Casablanca, and from Casablanca to Tangiers, where we were 
                  there for about a week. On August 15th my oldest son died. He 
                  was undernourished. We didn't have much food. He caught Malaria-Paludismo-so 
                  he died and he's buried in Tangiers. I started work for the 
                  British Intelligence Service. My wife and the new baby were 
                  living there and I was working for the British Intelligence, 
                  and after I placed a bomb in the German thing it exploded, and 
                  the story is right there. I was smuggled out of Tangiers to 
                  Gibraltar. I was there for a while because I resolved the problem 
                  of a spy that came in and we recognized him as being a German 
                  and not a Dane. Captain Townsend, the security officer, told 
                  me &quot;you're not a British Subject, so we can't give you 
                  a medal, but is there anything we can do for you.&quot; I said, 
                  &quot;Yeah, my wife and son are still in Tangiers, can you get 
                  them over to Gibraltar.&quot; It happened. After a while she 
                  was not allowed to come ashore in Gibraltar. Women were not 
                  allowed in that period.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We got on 
                  board the Yon Sobieski from the Gdinia American line. We went 
                  to England, and that's where I joined the Air Force. The Royal 
                  Dutch Naval Air Service, affiliated to the RAF. I was flying 
                  B-25's. Meanwhile, my daughter was born in Hereford, England 
                  on my birthday, November 15th. The most expensive birthday present 
                  I ever got. (laughs).</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That is 
                  up to England. In England I was flying, and later on I was demobilized 
                  back to Antwerp, Belgium. But the whole idea was&#133;.Oh, I 
                  forgot to tell you that I escaped from a camp in Tunis. We had 
                  been in a boat in Tunis to go to Malta. Malta was British at 
                  the time. There were 19 of us&#133;Somebody betrayed us. We 
                  went to a camp in Tunis. I've forgotten the name of the camp. 
                  There were 4 of us left. A Frenchman, a Czech, and English and 
                  myself. I have a God-given gift for language. I spoke Arabic. 
                  One day during the Ramadan we killed the guard and got away, 
                  because he was on a hill and it was 12:00 o'clock when the train 
                  came past, and it has to make a turn around the hill and slows 
                  down. We jumped into a freight car for cows. And in Tangiers 
                  I placed a bomb in the German laboratorium that they had, full 
                  of telescopes to see where they're going in Gibraltar. It exploded, 
                  dominis secularum, amen, for all the Germans there.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">My wife 
                  played a very interesting role there. In Tangiers, the secretary 
                  of the German Embassy was in love with my wife, which is ok. 
                  He drank a lot and she got out of him exactly what I needed 
                  to know. She was always in the background but always there. 
                  We were always together,. When she was there and we were there, 
                  we went to London patriotic school and Madeline went to the 
                  Obram Hills. And then to Hereford, where my daughter was born. 
                  Madeline was always right there when she was needed.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I became 
                  aware of the Germans and the Jews in Antwerp because we were 
                  close to the German border. We knew what was going on. In 1936 
                  there was the Olympiad in Berlin. Hitler's Olympiad. Quite a 
                  few countries didn't participate there. So they had a counter 
                  Olympiad in Barcelona, Spain, which was social democratic. Don't 
                  mix that up with Communism, because it isn't. That's where I 
                  got to know a guy by the name of Jack de Challard. Never forget 
                  him. He was from Canada from the people that came to fight against 
                  Franco. He started with that. On the same day-the 18th of July, 
                  1936, Franco started his Civil War, which was nothing else but 
                  he was being paid by the Germans, and by the French, and by 
                  the British, and by the Americans. But they won't accept that. 
                  It is a fact. They didn't know what was going. Most people didn't 
                  know what was going on. We knew. We had family. My family was 
                  in Germany. It was Crystal Night-the night that they broke all 
                  the glass and windows of all the Jewish Synagogues, shops. They 
                  broke everything that belonged to the Jewish people. When we 
                  were on the road, we met so many people that had escaped.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">My three 
                  sisters and my mother in law went to Switzerland. My father 
                  in law died in Auschwitz. I found out later on that all my family 
                  was killed in Auschwitz and in Sobibor. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">My brother 
                  was missing. He was shot by the Germans in Antwerp. He was delivering 
                  false identity coupons and so on, and he got caught in the raid 
                  and that I heard from the people that were there. After I left, 
                  all of this happened. My family and everybody was taken by the 
                  Germans. We never found my brother's body. I have a big book 
                  here full of names of people, 500,000 Dutchmen that have been 
                  murdered. My Grandma in Sobibor from my father's side. My grandparents 
                  from my mother's side in Auschwitz. Three Uncles and Aunts in 
                  Auschwitz. Cousins, Auschwitz.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The people 
                  who are trying to tell other people that it never happened are 
                  either ignorant or they don't want to know the truth. I have 
                  met some of these people. There were people that denied the 
                  fact that there was a holocaust. They denied the fact that the 
                  Jews were blamed for everything that was wrong. They said, &quot;oh, 
                  that's exaggerated.&quot; Six million Jews were murdered. Six 
                  million other people-Gypsies, Poles, Russians, Dutch, Christians, 
                  were murdered. 12 millions in total. These people who are saying 
                  these things things ought to be, as my friend would say from 
                  Montana, they should be hung, drawn, and quartered. Or hung 
                  first and then give them a fair trial. Of course that's a joke, 
                  but I can understand that. How can they deny these things? Look 
                  what happened in Kosovo? Look what happened all over the world? 
                  These people should be taught, first of all, what was going 
                  on. They should read stories. And I wrote one of them. I wrote 
                  a book on it, which at the present moment is being re-edited, 
                  corrected.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When I was 
                  on the run with my wife and my little boy from France, Tangiers, 
                  and so on, I was hearing the words from everybody that most 
                  of them murdered were refugees. In Orran, I wrote it in the 
                  story that I gave you, I was in the Salvation Army. My son was 
                  born December 19, 1940 on a Friday and on December the 22nd 
                  the Salvation Army had a party for the &quot;pauper's meal&quot; 
                  and I went there. I was the only Jew. No I was not the only 
                  Jew, there were three other ones: Mary, Joseph and Jesus. There 
                  were Poles, Czechs-you name the nationality that was occupied 
                  by the Germans. And I sang the song, &quot;Oh, Holy Night&quot; 
                  in French, and when I finished I saw all of these people, all 
                  refugees that were sitting there, crying. And all of a sudden, 
                  all of them begun to sing the same song in his own language. 
                  I head from them what was going on. They told me that they had 
                  run away.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When I was 
                  going to Gibraltar I was smuggled out at the coal bunker. There 
                  were two guys in it. One of them was the Viscomte d' Jonghe 
                  d'Artois. His mother was lady in waiting to the late Queen Astrid 
                  of Belgium. The other guy, Juteyenne (sp?) he was running away 
                  from the Foreign Legion. You should have seen how they looked 
                  like. They had escaped from Tetawan and they also went to Gibraltar. 
                  You should have heard what they told. The murders, the torture 
                  that was going on in those camps. In that one camp about 19&#133;there 
                  were 4 left. Another 15 were murdered, tortured to death. The 
                  camp that I was in.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I never 
                  told my wife what I was doing, and that was the best thing that 
                  I could do. Even when I was in England, flying&#133;I never 
                  told her where I was flying. I was a navigator, bombardier, 
                  air gunner. And I was flying the B-25. My crew, there were three 
                  of them-the pilot, Joshua van Leeuwen, he was Protestant, John 
                  Meyer was the bellygunner, he was Catholic, Brandon was the 
                  tail gunner, he was Islam, and I was Jewish. And the joke went 
                  through the camp if one God isn't there to help us, the other 
                  one will be.<br>
                  Crazy things like that when you think of it.</font></p>
