  At the funeral for former Chama councilman Ben Martinez, a priest
              said &quot;clearly, loudly and without hesitation that the Lord
              vomited people like Ben out of his mouth to hell,&quot; according
              to a lawsuit filed by Martinez's family against the Archdiocese
              of Santa Fe.</font></p>
          <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Rev. Scott Mansfield's comments at the 80-year-old man's funeral,
            the lawsuit states, have had a devastating effect, resulting in nightmares,
            depression, anxiety attacks and the need for psychological counseling
            for Martinez's family.</font></p>
          <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;It has really damaged us, as well as our children,&quot; Martinez's
            daughter-in-law, Joanne Martinez, said this week. &quot;It's hard
            to believe a man of the cloth would actually talk that way about
            a person. God is supposed to be love, but we didn't see any love
            that day.&quot;</font></p>
          <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Mansfield is now the priest for Holy Child Parish in Tijeras. A
            receptionist there said he couldn't be reached because he is on a
            retreat in Colorado.</font></p>
          <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Celine Radigan, spokeswoman of the archdiocese, said, &quot;Father
            Scott Mansfield has denied the allegations that are stated in the
            complaint.&quot;</font></p>
          <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The archdiocese's policy is to withhold comment on
              pending legal matters, she said, &quot;and thus we intend to follow
            the legal process.&quot;</font></p>
          <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The archdiocese has responded to the lawsuit, filed last month in
            District Court in Tierra Amarilla. The suit seeks a jury trial and
            punitive and compensatory damages against the archdiocese and Mansfield,
            who presided at Martinez's funeral on June 17, 2002, at St. Patrick's
            Parish in Chama.</font></p>
          <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Mansfield was angry that Ben Martinez had not attended church regularly
            during the last year of his life, the lawsuit claims, even though
            Martinez was ill with emphysema.</font></p>
          <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At the funeral, attended by about 200 people, Mansfield
              said, &quot;Ben
            Martinez was a Catholic in name only, and if you are not a true Catholic,
            you are going to hell,&quot; the lawsuit states.</font></p>
          <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Mansfield used &quot;graphic terms to describe the fact that Ben
            Martinez had been living in sin and that if a person is lukewarm
            in their faith, as he stated Ben Martinez had been, that the Lord
            will vomit you out,&quot; the complaint says.</font></p>
          <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Kathleen Kentish Lucero, the Martinez family's attorney, said Mansfield
            left the parish a few weeks after the funeral, but she is not aware
            of any disciplinary action taken against him by the archdiocese.</font></p>
          <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The archdiocese's initial response to a possible lawsuit was that
            Mansfield's comments were protected by the First Amendment because
            they were made by a priest during a religious ceremony, Lucero said.</font></p>
          <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But Lucero says Mansfield's remarks are not protected speech because
            they departed from Catholic Church doctrine and were intended to
            hurt Martinez's family. Two family members have put their Chama homes
            on the market because they were so humiliated by Mansfield's remarks,
            Lucero said.</font></p>
          <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Priests, like all human beings, should be accountable for
            their conduct,&quot; Lucero said.</font></p>
          <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Martinez owned Ben's Lounge and ran a towing company, Lucero said.</font></p>
          <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Andy Rivas, a deacon trainee who helped Mansfield with the funeral,
            later was removed from his position because he spoke out against
            Mansfield's comments, the lawsuit states.</font></p>
          <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While walking to the grave site, the complaint says,
              Mansfield told Rivas &quot;he did not give a (expletive) what the
              people of Chama thought, that he had put the Martinez family in
            their place.&quot;</font></p>
          <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The lawsuit also alleges a parish newsletter issued after the funeral
            threatened parishioners with excommunication if they complained about
            Mansfield's remarks.</font></p>
          <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The lawsuit was filed by Martinez's widow, Joann Martinez, Martinez's
            three sons, one daughter and their spouses.</font></p>
          <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On Easter Sunday of 1987, Ben Martinez's first wife, Bernie Martinez,
            and his daughter, Anita Aragon, were both shot to death by the daughter's
            estranged husband, Daniel Aragon. Ben Martinez subsequently remarried. </font></p>

            New (2006) series of letters by and about <b>Don Schrader,</b> who 
            really stirs 'em up in Albuquerque. From <a href="http://www.alibi.com">Weekly 
            Alibi</a>. And see earlier exchange (2003) below.</i></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Say No to Sniveling</b> 
            </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dear Alibi, The 
            Alibi recently published two letters criticizing Don Schrader's letter 
            “Crap No One Needs” [Letters, “Reverend Don” and “Born in the U.S.A.,” 
            Aug. 31-Sept. 6]. The implication of the letters is that Don is somehow 
            a parasite to our society. Nothing could be further from the truth. 
            </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Yes, Don has very 
            strong beliefs and he lives them more consistently than any other 
            Albuquerque resident. As such, he makes most of the rest of us uncomfortable 
            because we are all compromised compared to Don's standard of behavior. 
            </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Don never said 
            he refuses to pay taxes. He refuses to pay federal taxes. The sidewalks 
            he treads (always on shod feet, incidentally) are paved with the city 
            property taxes he pays through his rent. The UNM facilities he patronizes 
            are paid for in part by the state sales taxes he pays when he buys 
            his food at La Moñtanita, like many of the rest of us. It is federal 
            taxes he objects to, since roughly half of every federal tax dollar 
            is used to pay for militarism (war preparations, war waging, war casualties, 
            past, present and future), regardless of which party is in the White 
            House or in control of Congress. In his effort to minimize complicity 
            with militarism he highlights the hypocrisy in the rest of us. As 
            for his “sniveling,” I've known Don for two decades and have never 
            known him to snivel about anything. He states his positions in a forthright, 
            mature manner and lets the chips fall as they may. Instead of engaging 
            in either inaccurate accusations or emotional character assassinations, 
            these two readers might want to walk a mile in Don's shoes before 
            they criticize his life decisions.</font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Dear Alibi, </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Count 
            on a Don Schrader letter to bring out the capitalist fundamentalists 
            screaming “blasphemy!” Two [Letters, “Reverend Don” and “Born in the 
            U.S.A.,” Aug. 31-Sept. 6] accused Don, as always, of being an ungrateful 
            leech, claiming that if you want sidewalks and schools then you should 
            shut up about Our Boys slaughtering Asians. Sidewalks and schools 
            are funded by local taxes: sales tax, property assessment, etc. Your 
            IRS tithe goes overwhelmingly for Guys With Guns and Fat-Assed Analysts 
            telling us that we can’t afford Social Security or Medicare anymore. 
            </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To say that our 
            soldiers mean well is pointless. Has there ever been an invading army 
            that thinks they’re doing it for the sake of chaos and evil? Soldiers 
            always believe they are killing so their mothers and daughters will 
            be safe. It’s just comical to assert that military obedience training 
            makes you more qualified than Don to analyze foreign policy. Hooray 
            for Saint Don! </font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Don Schrader, 
            congratulations on being worthless to society! You should be proud. 
            </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Yes, the war in 
            Iraq is a bad thing. I will not argue about that. That is only a small 
            portion of where tax money goes, however. Consider health care, education 
            and various other programs the government offers. And while this particular 
            war is not necessary, they sometimes unfortunately are. You may choose 
            to live as a communist or survivalist or anarchist or worthless leech 
            ... or whatever the hell you want to call yourself, but many of the 
            rest of us are quite happy as capitalists living in a democratic republic, 
            and are willing to fight to defend this ideal. If we don't fight to 
            defend our ideals, others will fight us to push theirs. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">You also chose 
            to make some snide comments about our soldiers. I guess this is to 
            be expected of a sniveling coward such as yourself. You choose to 
            let others do your dirty work while you sit and whine. Speaking as 
            someone who's seen the Air Force, I can assure you that soldiers are 
            humans, same as everyone else. Soldiers have the same fears as anyone 
            else and, yes, they also have consciences. They made the choice, however, 
            to defend what they believe in with their lives, whatever other motivations 
            they may have had. But there's good news for you yet, Don! In the 
            U.S.A., thanks much to the efforts of our brave and wonderful soldiers, 
            you have the right to be the worthless and sniveling little whiner 
            that you are! And being an American myself, I have the right to point 
            that out to you! Isn't that just swell? </font></p>

            us to live as you do if we protest the war machine. You obviously 
            don’t have the luxury of caring for dependents, for one thing. I applaud

            not ever benefit from the many other tax programs the rest of us fund,

            for peace while paying for war is like praying for health while hogging 
            out on junk food! Soldiers risk their bodies and their lives to wage 
            war, but, sadly, most U.S. peace activists do not break their addiction 
            of buying what no one needs in order to live simply below the federal 
            income taxable level to stop baying for war! As long as you spend 
            like crazy for crap no one needs, you will insist on having an income 
            larger than the taxable level. Your buying addiction keeps you paying 
            year after year from every paycheck for U.S. atrocities all over the 
            world. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Would you pay 
            to have your pet cats and dogs tortured and bombed? Would you pay 
            to cripple, make homeless and murder neighborhood children on your 
            street? The children of Iraq, Lebanon and the West Bank are no less 
            precious, no less human than the children on your street. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Your federal income 
            tax pays to burn babies, to paralyze parents, to blind grandparents 
            ... I refused to be a soldier in 1969 during the Vietnam War. For 
            me, as a conscientious objector to all wars, to pay federal income 
            tax to train other Americans, largely the poor and people of color, 
            to become professional hired killers to murder or command with no 
            conscience would be more evil than being a soldier myself. Many U.S. 
            progressives spend endless energy and hours analyzing, measuring, 
            protecting and cursing the beast (the U.S. Empire) while they keep 
            on feeding it with their federal income tax dollars and their consumer 
            dollars. Many U.S. progressives are addicted to the loot of this empire 
            while they damn the blood! The loot always is drenched in blood. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I have no right 
            to pay tax to do to other people what I do not want them to do to 
            me. Nothing in life is more important than refusing to pay federal 
            income tax for war—no matter who is president. The best way to refuse 
            to pay federal income tax for war, with no fines and no threats from 
            the IRS, is to live simply, below the federal income taxable level. 
            </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The federal income 
            taxable level for 2006 for a single person under 65 who is not blind 
            is $8,450, for a married couple filing together—$16,900. I lived well 
            all of 2005 on $3,885—less than the taxable level. I have paid no 
            federal income tax for war for 27 years. I pledge never to pay the 
            rest of my life. </font></p>

          <p><font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Don Schrader? Here we go again. Blah, blah, blah. You are an anachronism.
              You are out of place and time. You long for a passionate lifelong romance--good
              luck! You won't find it parading your ass up and down Central. Your
              landlord should kick your naked ass out of that 12' x 14' box you call
              home, so that you can see what the world is really like. No computer,
              no TV: Where do you come by your warped view of the world? Besides
              the Alibi, what is your source of news of current events? Do you actually
              peruse a newspaper or news magazine? Or do you base your fucked-up
              image of the country on the evil passersby in oil-burners who honk
              at your foolish and simplistic propagandistic signs? </font></font></p>
          <p><font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">By the way, in the interest of &quot;full disclosure&quot;--what is
              the source of your $3,760? Since you don't work, do you produce anything
              to earn an income? Or do you live off some trust fund from a deceased
              parent? Are you milking the system for some disability? Do you vote?
              If you don't vote, your opinion means nothing anyway--you are irrelevant. </font></font></p>
          <p><font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Do you realize the &quot;U.S. War Machine&quot; maintains your right
              to live and act the way you do, and yes--even to insanely rant against
              the &quot;Empire.&quot; I think it would be appropriate--and divinely
              poetic--to drop your semi-clad butt into Saddam's Iraq--say, from a
              Huey helicopter--and watch as your Iraqi brothers and sisters' beat
              you for being naked, cut out your tongue for speaking out and then
              stone you to death for being gay. Such an &quot;enlightened&quot; society
              might illustrate to you just how lucky you are to live in the United
              States, where people only laugh at the sight of you. </font></font></p>
