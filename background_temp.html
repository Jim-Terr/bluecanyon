  <p><strong>Letter to Senator Orrin Hatch</strong><br>
            July 29, 2002 </p>
          <p>Dear Senator Hatch,</p>
          <p>At recent hearings on proposed TIPS* program you challenged your 
            fellow committee members to tell you how this proposed program would 
            differ from &quot;America's Most Wanted&quot; in its effectiveness 
            in catching criminals.<br>
            <br>
            In case no one answered you at the time, the obvious difference is 
            that America's Most Wanted seeks wanted or convicted criminals already 
            identified, with photo ID, whereas TIPS invites people to fantasize 
            and accuse regarding anyone and anything their over-active imaginations 
            might relate to terrorism.<br>
            <br>
            That's a huge difference.</p>

            <em>Howard Zinn's A People's History of the United States, 1492-present 
            </em><br>
            (Harper Collins) (also available in audio format) </p>
          <p>If you read only one book this year… (don't you love that expression?) 
            Anyhow, things will never be the same for you after reading this powerful 
            book, which has now sold over a million copies. Known for its lively, 
            clear prose as well as its scholarly research, A People's History 
            of the United States is the only volume to tell America's story from 
            the point of view of -- and in the words of -- America's women, factory 
            workers and &quot;middle class&quot;, African Americans, Native Americans, 
            working poor, and immigrant laborers. In other words, the majority, 
            the everyday people—you, most likely.</p>
          <p>Covering Christopher Columbus's arrival through President Clinton's 
            first term, A People's History of the United States features insightful 
            analysis of the most important events in our history. Revised, updated, 
            and featuring a new afterword by the author.</p>
          <p>&quot;Those accustomed to the texts of an earlier generation, in 
            which the rise of American democracy and the growth of national power 
            were the embodiments of progress, may be startled by professor Zinn's 
            narrative.&quot; -Eric Foner. </p>
          <p>&quot;A brilliant and moving history of the American people from 
            the point of view of those who have been exploited politically and 
            economically, and whose plight has been largely omitted from most 
            histories&quot; -Library Journal</p>
          <p><em>From the Critics</em><br>
            From Eric Foner <br>
            Professor Zinn writes with an enthusiasm rarely encountered in the 
            leaden prose of academic history, and his text is studded with telling 
            quotations from labor leaders, war resisters and fugitive slaves. 
            There are vivid descriptions of events that are usually ignored, such 
            as the great railroad strike of 1877 and the brutal suppression of 
            the Philippine independence movement at the turn of this century. 
            Professor Zinn's chapter on Vietnam—bringing to life once again the 
            free-fire zones, secret bombings, massacres and cover-ups—should be 
            required reading for a new generation of students now facing conscription.<br>
            <br>
            From Howard Fast <br>
            One of the most important books I have ever read in a long life of 
            reading...It's a wonderful, splendid book—a book that should be read 
            by every American, student or otherwise, who wants to understand his 
            country, its true history, and its hope for the future.<br>

    <p><strong>SOCIAL SECURITY for VERY SPECIAL PEOPLE </strong> </p>
    <p> Perhaps we are asking the wrong questions during<br>
      election years. Our Senators and Congressmen do not<br>
      pay into Social Security and, of course, they do not<br>
      collect from it. Social Security benefits were not<br>
      suitable for persons of their rare elevation in society.</p>
    <p> They felt they should have a special plan for<br>
      themselves. Many years ago they voted in their own<br>
      benefit plan. In more recent years, no congressperson<br>
      has felt the need to change it. After all, it is a great plan.</p>
    <p> For all practical purposes their plan works like this:<br>
      When they retire, they continue to draw the same pay<br>
      until they die, except it may increase from time to<br>
      time for cost of living adjustments.</p>
    <p> For example, former Senator Byrd and Congressman<br>
      White and their wives may expect to draw<br>
      $7,800,000.00 (that's Seven Million, Eight-Hundred<br>
      Thousand), with their wives drawing $275,000.00<br>
      during the last years of their lives. This is<br>
      calculated on an average life span for each.<br>
      Their cost for this excellent plan is $00.00. Nada.<br>
      Zilch. This little perk they voted for themselves is<br>
      free to them. You and I pick up the tab for this plan.</p>
    <p> The funds for this fine retirement plan come directly<br>
      from the General Funds--our tax dollars at work!<br>
      From our own Social Security Plan, which you and I<br>
      pay (or have paid) into--every payday until we retire<br>
      (which amount is matched by our employer)--we can<br>
      expect to get an average $1,000 per month after<br>
      retirement. Or, in other words, we would have to<br>
      collect our average of $1,000. monthly benefits for<br>
      68 years and one (l) month to equal Senator Bradley's benefits!</p>
    <p> Social Security could be very good if only one small<br>
      change were made. And that change would be to jerk<br>
      the Golden Fleece Retirement Plan from under the<br>
      Senators and Congressmen. Put them into the Social<br>
      Security plan with the rest of us and then watch how <br>
      fast they would fix it.</p>
    <p> If enough people receive this, maybe a seed of<br>
      awareness will be planted and maybe good changes will evolve.</p>
    <p>(Source unknown. What other very special congressional programs and privileges—health 
      care, personnel rules, etc.—serve to insulate these princes and princesses 
      from the rules and tribulations of those they supposedly serve?)</p>

          <p>Brent Scowcroft, the former National Security Advisor, says a U.S. 
            invasion of Iraq &quot;could turn the whole region into a cauldron 
            and, thus, destroy the war on terrorism.&quot; He also says &quot;there

            less to the Sept. 11 attacks.&quot;<br>
            <br>
            Senator Chuck Hagel (R-NE) says the CIA has &quot;absolutely no evidence&quot; 
            that Iraq possesses or will soon possess nuclear weapons.<br>
            <br>
            Henry Kissinger says, &quot;The notion of justified pre- emption runs 
            <br>
            counter to modern international law, which sanctions the use of force 
            in self-defense only against actual -- not potential -- threats.&quot; 
            <br>
            Kissinger also says, &quot;American military intervention in Iraq 
            would be supported only grudgingly, if at all, by most European allies.&quot;

            <br>

                <p class="MsoNormal" style="border: medium none; padding: 0in"><i>An 
                  excellent and timely essay I'm proud to say was written by a 
                  fellow Santa Fean, which brilliantly captures the bumbling, 
                  well-meaning malevolence of our president.</i></p>
                <p class="MsoNormal" style="border: medium none; padding: 0in">&nbsp;<b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial">Summer 
                  Before the War</span></b>&nbsp;</p>
                <p class="MsoNormal" style="border: medium none; padding: 0in">It 
                  is summer and baseball time, beach time, and America is preoccupied 
                  with corporate betrayal.&nbsp; Still, Alan Greenspan says that 
                  the economy is improving.&nbsp; The Twin Towers will be rebuilt, 
                  somehow.&nbsp; Trust the market, urges President Bush.&nbsp; 
                  One can almost hear the drone of flies and mosquitoes in Washington’s 
                  foggy bottom.&nbsp; No one seems to notice that this administration 
                  is cart wheeling America down the road to war.&nbsp;</p>
                <p class="MsoNormal" style="border: medium none; padding: 0in">Two 
                  newspapers, one in Lebanon and one in Turkey, last week reported 
                  that US reconnaissance troops have already crossed Iraq's borders 
                  in small numbers, checking out the terrain.&nbsp; This follows 
                  the president’s statement three weeks ago that he will decide 
                  for himself, unilaterally, when and whether he will declare 
                  Iraq an enemy and when and where he will go to war. &nbsp;</p>
                <p class="MsoNormal" style="border: medium none; padding: 0in">In 
                  response to the president’s call, weapons makers have added 
                  a work shift to speed production of laser guided bombs.&nbsp; 
                  Production at one factory is reported by the Associated Press 
                  to be at its highest levels in 15 years.&nbsp; Analysts say 
                  the planned use is in Iraq.&nbsp; The idea is to find precise 
                  bombs that can be used against Saddam Hussein’s military infrastructure.&nbsp; 
                  The dream is that only soldiers will be killed, civilians spared.&nbsp; 
                  It is a kind of hubris.&nbsp;</p>
                <p class="MsoNormal" style="border: medium none; padding: 0in">The 
                  president, in a similar mind, has told the Palestinians that 
                  they need a new leader.&nbsp; He will not tolerate the one they 
                  have.&nbsp; He is telling the Iraqis the same thing.&nbsp; India, 
                  seeing its chance, now asks him to tell that to the Pakistanis.&nbsp; 
                  Instruct them to get a new leader, too.&nbsp; George Bush is 
                  comfortable being asked.&nbsp; He likes being in charge.&nbsp; 
                  He has a propensity to speak in the first person, saying &quot;I&quot; 
                  expect Israelis to do this or that, or &quot;I&quot; expect 
                  Palestinians to find a replacement for Arafat, as if the American 
                  president were in charge of the world.&nbsp;</p>
                <p class="MsoNormal" style="border: medium none; padding: 0in">This 
                  tendency to personalize his power is not a sign of maturity 
                  in a president, but rather a sign of grandiosity.&nbsp; Bush 
                  clearly does not mean evil.&nbsp; He means well.&nbsp; But he 
                  seems to lack the depth to see when he crosses the line from 
                  democratic leader to imperialist.&nbsp; It is the kind of mentality 
                  that Kaiser Wilhelm had in the early part of the last century 
                  when he declared certain parts of Africa to be his alone to 
                  influence or control.&nbsp; That arrogance led the way to the 
                  First World War.&nbsp; George Bush is not a bad man.&nbsp; But 
                  he is limited.&nbsp; And now, like the Kaiser, because of a 
                  desperate lack of perspective, he is dangerous.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
                <p class="MsoNormal" style="border: medium none; padding: 0in">It 
                  is perhaps too much to expect Washington to react.&nbsp; It 
                  may be too much to expect the mass media to hem him in.&nbsp; 
                  They are dependent to a high degree on a president’s favor and 
                  do not want to alienate the sources that give them the news.&nbsp; 
                  But peacemakers all across this land should be alert.&nbsp; 
                  This summer is shaping up as an emergency.&nbsp; The president 
                  is using troops in reconnaissance in the area of the target, 
                  he is stockpiling weapons for an offensive, he has announced 
                  an intention to usurp the powers of the Congress to declare 
                  war and to do so at a time and place of his sole choosing.&nbsp; 
                  &nbsp;</p>
                <p class="MsoNormal" style="border: medium none; padding: 0in">A 
                  war upon an Islamic nation which is unprovoked will give generations 
                  of Muslims excuse for righteous anger and retaliation against 
                  the United States. And how will we say that this is a war to 
                  protect democracy when it is militarism, as in ancient Rome, 
                  unprovoked, without the rule of law?&nbsp; President Bush is 
                  therefore likely to unleash an historical wave that he has never 
                  contemplated because history is not his thing.&nbsp; But for 
                  some of the rest of us, it is our thing, and if we are to have 
                  a long run, we had better start seeking out and giving courage 
                  to voices of restraint.</p>

  <strong>AND DOES <em>THIS </em>SOUND FAMILIAR?</strong> 
  <p>&quot;Why of course the people don't want war. Why should some poor 
            slob on a farm want to risk his life in a war when the best he can 
            get out of it is to come back to his farm in one piece? Naturally 
            the common people don't want war neither in Russia, nor in England, 
            nor for that matter in Germany. That is understood. But, after all, 
            it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy and <em>it 
            is always a simple matter to drag the people along</em>, whether it 
            is a democracy, or a fascist dictatorship, or a parliament, or a communist 
            dictatorship. </p>
          <p>Voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding 
            of the leaders. That is easy. <em>All you have to do is tell them 
            they are being attacked</em>, and denounce the peacemakers for lack 
            of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same 
            in any country.&quot;</p>
