                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The time 
                  I left Belgium with my parents, we had an apartment, furniture 
                  and everything, and I didn't know what to take. I said to my 
                  husband: &quot;How long are we going to stay&quot;? And he said, 
                  &quot;I don't know.&quot; He said, &quot;Take clothes for the 
                  kids, don't take anything for me because I will go in the Army.&quot; 
                  And so I took clothes for the baby&#133;&#133;We knew we had 
                  to start getting out because the Germans started bombing the 
                  school right where we are living in the middle of the night. 
                  I woke my husband who was still asleep. He was a very good sleeper. 
                  I said, &quot;George, get up, they are bombing and the war is 
                  started.&quot; I had a hard time to wake him up and then we 
                  went downstairs and we took the baby and I forgot the bottle, 
                  and I say, you'd better get the bottle, we need the bottle.&quot; 
                  We stayed there until the bombing was a bit less, and he said, 
                  &quot;We'd better go to my mother.&quot; She had a house near 
                  the airport. But then you know that the War started and that 
                  it would be&#133;.And he told us that they would not take people 
                  of the Germans. The War was that we couldn't fight against them.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We are in 
                  Belgium, not in the Netherlands. My husband said he talked to 
                  the police and they said, &quot;We thought you were gone already 
                  a long time.&quot;. Because you know the Jews were&#133;&#133;.? 
                  And that is the first one they are going to bomb and get out. 
                  And when we were in the wagons where they put the cows. The 
                  train we were in. It was very bad. We didn't have water, we 
                  didn't have any toilet. We couldn't wash ourselves for four 
                  days and four nights. I couldn't wash the baby. Then the Red 
                  Cross came sometimes and gave you a bit of food. We didn't have 
                  milk in four days. I didn't know what to feed them. People were 
                  fighting for food already. We got one loaf for 20 people and 
                  so it was very nice we made it through there. If you had to 
                  go, you had to go under the train, or in a can behind a blanket. 
                  The men it was easier. When we arrived in France we were very 
                  happy. But we didn't know where we arrived. They didn't tell 
                  you. And no where what we saw was already standing. And when 
                  we stopped, we were standing there. They attacked some of the 
                  trains because we were with more than one. They attacked some 
                  of the trains already too. So when we arrived there in France 
                  we were happy to be there, and it was only a little country 
                  place. We couldn't find a place to live together. We lived by 
                  the Bixschotelei (Berchem) and my husband had to translate for 
                  the people. In Belgium we don't speak French. We all spoke French. 
                  That helped.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There were 
                  only two barbers. My husband was a barber before, too. And they 
                  asked him if he wanted to be a barber and help out. So I helped 
                  too. I was expecting five months and I helped to put soap on 
                  the men's faces and all that. After a few months when the War 
                  was finished in France, we thought of going away from there. 
                  We went just in time. Because after we left, they took my mother 
                  in camp. They took my sisters in camp, they took my father in 
                  camp. And we managed to survive because we went to Switzerland. 
                  Two sisters went first and they managed with some boys, and 
                  they managed to go to Switzerland. My father didn't want to 
                  go because he said, &quot;I promised that I would come back 
                  to the camp commander,&quot;and he was going back and that's 
                  why he died in Auschwitz. My sister survived the War. They were 
                  in camp all of the time in Switzerland to work. Then at a certain 
                  time after the War they let you go back to Belgium if you wanted 
                  to. We didn't have any idea where we were. Once we were on the 
                  door we couldn't write to them. And so when we came to England, 
                  I didn't speak a word of English and was expecting my daughter. 
                  I was in London in a Hotel, and in the bombing we had the V-1 
                  and V-2. There were very bad blackouts, no TV. Just the radio. 
                  I felt very bad and very lonely, and so I wrote my husband and 
                  I said, &quot;I want to go to the Country. I don't want to stay 
                  in London.&quot; And he said &quot;Go to the Country. If you 
                  can manage it without speaking a word of English, it is not 
                  easy.&quot; I did it. I still don't know now how I did it, but 
                  I went to the country with my son and with a big tummy and we 
                  arrived there, and we went to two places in the country. And 
                  while I was in the country there was one place that was only 
                  for the women, where the men were all soldiers. Different languages 
                  going on there, French, Dutch, German, everything. A guy was 
                  there and taught me a bit of English and I was very happy about 
                  that.<br>
                  He teach me too how to save some money and put it in the bank. 
                  And after I had my daughter there, all the kids had whooping 
                  cough. She was a little baby and the doctor said, &quot;I don't 
                  want her to stay here. You'd better get your husband to come 
                  and pick her up.&quot; And I said to my husband, &quot;bring 
                  me to Richmond because it was &frac34; of an hour from London. 
                  And you had the river and the Cue Gardens, maybe you've heard 
                  of them or not. They are beautiful. And I said I can walk with 
                  the kids there, and would not feel so lonely.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">And I stayed 
                  there for at least three years. Before, I found an apartment, 
                  first I was with a lady and she spoke only English, and I couldn't 
                  speak English. Couldn't go to the store and buy bread. Had to 
                  show them with my hands that I wanted the bread.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When we 
                  were in Tangiers we kept the restaurant for a French woman who 
                  wanted to go on vacation. Before that, my son died already, 
                  so I only had one baby. He was a handful. He was 1-1/2 years. 
                  He was young. I had to keep the keys for the maid because we 
                  had soap that was rationed. Everything was rationed. George 
                  kept a bar. And I was sitting at night in the bar and the German 
                  consul came and sat near me and I tried to get some information. 
                  He bought me a drink and that's the way George managed to get 
                  that bomb there, because I gave him the information. From Tangiers, 
                  it wasn't easy for me either because I couldn't find a job. 
                  It was very hard. They didn't tell you that you couldn't work 
                  when you were a stranger. And we spent the money we got from 
                  the refugees, and we were starving. My husband started smoking. 
                  He managed to get a place for me. There was jeunne fille, Catholic. 
                  I was the only one coming with a baby and a big tummy. The other 
                  were not married-all young girls. I made a good friend there, 
                  and she said, &quot;Do you have any clothes for the baby,&quot; 
                  and I said &quot;No, I have nothing.&quot; And she said, &quot; 
                  I will try to get you some clothes when the baby is there,&quot; 
                  and she did. And she sent us to a Jewish lady. And when my husband 
                  came there he said, &quot;I am Jew too&quot;. She laughed, and 
                  said, &quot;How come you managed to get there?&quot; He said, 
                  well he was the only one who helped us-the Catholic people. 
                  The Jews didn't help us, the Dutch also didn't help us. We came 
                  into Casablanca tired, sitting in the train all day with two 
                  babies, and changed from the trains and then we came into Calablanca, 
                  the consul tried to run away. George went after him through 
                  the back door and he said, &quot;Why do you run away from us, 
                  you should be here to help us.&quot; And he said, &quot;you'd 
                  better get out of Casablanca. I didn't ask you to come here. 
                  And if you don't tomorrow, I will put you all in prison.&quot; 
                  That was the Dutch Consul, can you imagine. My husband looked 
                  all day long to find a place where we could sleep. And we managed 
                  to sleep by the marine.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Dutch 
                  consul tried to run away from us and he told us that we had 
                  to leave because otherwise he would put us in prison. We are 
                  Dutch and we lived in Belgium, but we were Dutch. My husband 
                  had to get papers to go to Africa. He went on the bike to Toulouse 
                  and he got a passport. He still has that passport. He can show 
                  you, if you want. We didn't have a passport at all. With that 
                  passport we managed to go to Africa, but the first ship that 
                  came didn't let us on, because we didn't have enough papers. 
                  We had to wait for the second ship, and when the ship came, 
                  it was a French captain. I was expecting to have my son in my 
                  arm, and he said, &quot;Let Madame Go First.&quot; My husband 
                  said, &quot;That's my wife,&quot;. And he looked at me and he 
                  looked at the papers and my husband wrote a letter to himself 
                  saying that it was my sister who lived there. He said, &quot;this 
                  is what I need. You can go.&quot; In two minutes we got on that 
                  ship, I still didn't have money to get a cabin. There was an 
                  English lady and she was really nice. She said to me, &quot;I 
                  have a couch in the cabin, you can use that.&quot; But I couldn't 
                  sleep with the baby in the couch, these small couches, you know, 
                  so I didn't sleep all night. George slept outside in a chair 
                  and he slept better than me.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Then we 
                  arrived in England and it was very difficult for me. And when 
                  we went to the country, it was still difficult. My husband picked 
                  me up when I had to leave with my daughter.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In England 
                  people were very helpful. They tried to tell you that if you 
                  were afraid, go to the underground, and go down. But they didn't 
                  tell you that the light goes out and have to go down 500 steps, 
                  and five months expecting and my son under my arm. I went down 
                  all of these steps and then came up and the air raid was finished. 
                  After a week I had enough of this and went to the country. For 
                  5 years I lived in Richmond 3 years by a lady. She spoke French. 
                  I was lucky&#133;I was looking for an apartment. That lady had 
                  a little boy, and I hear that my boy had whooping cough and 
                  he had to stay there. And when he got better they called me 
                  and they said you can pick up your son. I can't have your son 
                  here, I already have two babies and this is my house, so you'd 
                  better look for a flat. I had a hard time to find one because 
                  in England it was like that, no cats, no dogs, no children, 
                  or if you were Jewish or not Jewish. It was very hard. I managed 
                  to find a lady, and she spoke French, and I could tell her everything. 
                  She said &quot;I would like to rent you the flat because I know 
                  you went though a lot,&quot; and she rented me the flat, but 
                  she charged me quite a bit of money and I didn't have it. She 
                  said, &quot;Do you know how to sew?&quot; And I said, &quot;Yes,&quot;. 
                  And she said, &quot;I have a lot of work for you. I will bring 
                  you the sewing machine down, and you can do some sewing for 
                  me and pay the rent with that too.&quot; And that's what I did. 
                  So for a couple of years we were there in England. Blackouts, 
                  everything rationed.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We didn't 
                  know what was happening to our families in the camps. That was 
                  the worst. We only knew when my husband went to Canada. And 
                  there he found an Uncle of mine. And he said your father died, 
                  told him, my father died in the concentration camp (Auschwitz), 
                  and that my mother and my sisters were in Switzerland, and we 
                  went back to Belgium then. About four years later we started 
                  to know what happened to them.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">My daughter 
                  was born, and she's a beautiful girl. She will have a birthday 
                  and she will be 56, right George? &quot;Fifty Seven,&quot; says 
                  George. Fifty-seven in November. That picture I showed you was 
                  about my two sons. My daughter was born in England. I had a 
                  lot of trouble with her. She got sick when she was a baby and 
                  I had to take her to the hospital. She had &quot;pink disease&quot;. 
                  I never heard about it. They call it &quot;pink disease&quot; 
                  it's a rash all over your body. She was a year old when she 
                  got better.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I think 
                  it's terrible that these people say it never happened. I go 
                  to the star (sp?) with my husband, and I'm always talking about 
                  the War and that we had to run away, and what happened, and 
                  how the Germans behaved. I saw a German lady, and she had a 
                  family with Jews, and she knows what happened. And she said, 
                  &quot;I think it was the worst thing that ever happened in the 
                  world, that they can still not see what happened. The people 
                  who say it never happened I think they are dumb, because they 
                  should know better. If the parents don't teach them they will 
                  never know. And that's why they ask us already to talk to the 
                  schools here and to tell about it. We went to that school in&#133;..What 
                  is the name, George? &quot;Academy&quot;&#133;says George. &quot;Academy,&quot; 
                  And they asked us if they want us to talk about it. I never 
                  did it in my life, I was not a teacher. I talked about it and 
                  the kids were so interested, that the second half hour---you 
                  know you had a half hour and then you had to change teachers. 
                  And the second hour, they wanted to give them another teacher, 
                  and they said, &quot;No, we want that lady.&quot; So I talked 
                  about it, and it was the first time in my life. They were very 
                  interested.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For four 
                  hours, I had to talk with that consul. He arrested me already. 
                  And he said, &quot;Your husband ran away and we want to know 
                  where he is.&quot; And I say, &quot;I don't know where he is.&quot; 
                  I suppose I did know more or less that he was in England, but 
                  I didn't tell them that. And he said, &quot;Don't tell me that 
                  he never told you anything.&quot; And I said, &quot;No, he didn't&#133;He 
                  didn't want me to get in trouble so he never told me.&quot; 
                  And that was the truth. So he let me go after four hours interrogating. 
                  And then we went to England and we were all interrogated again&#133;..What 
                  is that place, George? You said you were there, in England, 
                  when we arrived at that school. George says, &quot;Patriotic 
                  School.&quot; She says: They took another four hours and they 
                  asked the same questions to my husband to see if we were telling 
                  the truth before they let us in England.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The passport 
                  shows George in the Army before the Air Force. This is in Canada, 
                  of Princess Margarita. This is my son's grave in Africa. That's 
                  a picture of the Dutch Naval Air Service. And that's a passport 
                  we got in Toulouse. A xerox copy. There's a stamp from every 
                  country that we went that was put in that passport. I had black 
                  hair then.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When my 
                  husband left Tangiers, you know, they got him out. I was left 
                  for two months. I got some letters from him. I didn't know where 
                  he was in Gibraltar. I couldn't get out because I had to have 
                  a passport&#133;.I had to have papers. One day he said to me, 
                  &quot;Well, you can make your papers. You are ready to go.&quot; 
                  So I went to the small ship and when we were going I went with 
                  my son who was just one year old. And then they started bombing. 
                  And the Germans and the English, and they were fighting, and 
                  that ship didn't go. So I had to go back to the hotel where 
                  I was living and say to that woman, &quot;well, I will stay 
                  another week, and see if another ship will come.&quot; And I 
                  had the last ship who ever went. After that there was no ship 
                  going anymore. And they didn't bring me to Gibraltar because 
                  there was only for men in the War. So I went on the Polish ship 
                  where 2000 men and 20 women and one baby-that was my son, a 
                  year old. And he called everybody &quot;Daddy&quot;&#133;..They 
                  were crazy with him. He was spoiled from every one. And I didn't 
                  have the food either for him. I needed bananas, I needed things. 
                  So we got it from the seamen in Gibraltar. There was a Polish 
                  boat, but I didn't speak Polish, so it was hard to make myself 
                  understand, but we managed. I had one steward who was keeping 
                  my son and he said, &quot;You go dancing, because we need every 
                  woman we can get to dance.&quot; We were only 20 woman on board 
                  and 2000 men and we all came from camps. They all got them out 
                  of camps. There were Dutch, French, Belgian, German. And then 
                  the boat went after all. And my husband came on the ship just 
                  before the boat left. He was a soldier already, so he was in 
                  the cabin downstairs, and got seasick&#133;Terrible. I got seasick 
                  too. All the men looking after me. They say, &quot;You go in 
                  back and we will bring you breakfast.&quot; I was spoiled. (laughs)&#133;&#133;</font><br>
