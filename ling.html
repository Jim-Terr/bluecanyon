    China&nbsp;(i/&nbsp;t&nbsp;a&nbsp;n&nbsp;/;&nbsp;Chinese:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;;&nbsp;pinyin:&nbsp;Zh&nbsp;nggu&oacute;),  officially the&nbsp;People's Republic of China, is a sovereign state located  in&nbsp;East Asia. It is the world's&nbsp;most populous country, with a  population of over 1.35&nbsp;billion. The PRC is a&nbsp;single-party  state&nbsp;governed by the&nbsp;Communist Party, with its seat of government in  the capital city of&nbsp;Beijing.[14]&nbsp;It exercises jurisdiction over  22&nbsp;provinces, five&nbsp;autonomous regions, four&nbsp;direct-controlled  municipalities&nbsp;(Beijing,&nbsp;Tianjin,&nbsp;Shanghai, and&nbsp;Chongqing),  and two mostly self-governing&nbsp;special administrative regions&nbsp;(Hong  Kong&nbsp;and&nbsp;Macau). The PRC also claims&nbsp;Taiwan&nbsp;&ndash; which is  controlled by the&nbsp;Republic of China&nbsp;(ROC), a separate political  entity &ndash; as its&nbsp;23rd province, a claim which is controversial due to the  complexpolitical status of Taiwan.[15]<br />
    Covering  approximately 9.6&nbsp;million square kilometers, China is the world's&nbsp;second-largest  country by land area,[16]&nbsp;and either the&nbsp;third or fourth-largest by  total area, depending on the method of measurement.[i]&nbsp;China's landscape  is vast and diverse, ranging from&nbsp;forest steppes&nbsp;and the&nbsp;Gobi&nbsp;and&nbsp;Taklamakan&nbsp;deserts&nbsp;in  the arid north tosubtropical&nbsp;forests in the wetter south.  The&nbsp;Himalaya,&nbsp;Karakoram,&nbsp;Pamir&nbsp;and&nbsp;Tian  Shan&nbsp;mountain ranges separate China from South and Central Asia.  The&nbsp;Yangtze&nbsp;andYellow Rivers, the third- and sixth-longest in the  world, run from the&nbsp;Tibetan Plateau&nbsp;to the densely populated eastern  seaboard. China's coastline along the Pacific Ocean is 14,500 kilometres  (9,000&nbsp;mi) long, and is bounded by  the&nbsp;Bohai,&nbsp;Yellow,&nbsp;East&nbsp;andSouth China Seas.<br />
    The&nbsp;history  of China&nbsp;goes back to the ancient civilization &ndash; one of the world's  earliest &ndash; that flourished in the fertile basin of the&nbsp;Yellow  River&nbsp;in the&nbsp;North China Plain. For millennia, China's political  system was based on hereditary monarchies, known asdynasties, beginning with  the semi-mythological&nbsp;Xia&nbsp;of the Yellow River basin (c. 2000 BCE).  Since 221 BCE, when the&nbsp;Qin Dynasty&nbsp;first conquered several states to  form a Chinese empire, the country has expanded, fractured and been reformed  numerous times. The&nbsp;Republic of China&nbsp;(ROC) overthrew the&nbsp;last  dynasty&nbsp;in 1911, and ruled theChinese mainland&nbsp;until 1949. After the  defeat of the&nbsp;Empire of Japan&nbsp;in&nbsp;World War II, the Communist  Party defeated the nationalist&nbsp;Kuomintang&nbsp;in mainland China and  established the People's Republic of China in Beijing on 1 October 1949, while  the Kuomintang relocated the ROC government to its present capital  of&nbsp;Taipei.<br />
    Since the  introduction of&nbsp;economic reforms in 1978, China has become one of the  world's&nbsp;fastest-growing&nbsp;major economies. As of 2013, it is the  world's second-largest economy by both&nbsp;nominal total  GDP&nbsp;and&nbsp;purchasing power parity (PPP), and is also the world's  largest exporter and importer of goods.[17]&nbsp;China is a  recognized&nbsp;nuclear weapons state&nbsp;and has the world's&nbsp;largest  standing army, with the&nbsp;second-largest defense budget.[18]&nbsp;The PRC  has been a&nbsp;United Nations&nbsp;member since 1971, when it replaced the ROC  as a&nbsp;permanent member&nbsp;of the&nbsp;U.N. Security Council. China is  also a member of numerous formal and informal multilateral organizations,  including theWTO,&nbsp;APEC,&nbsp;BRICS, the&nbsp;Shanghai Cooperation  Organisation, the&nbsp;BCIM&nbsp;and the&nbsp;G-20. China is a regional power  within Asia and has been characterized as a&nbsp;potential superpower&nbsp;by a  number of commentators.[19][20]<br />

    The word  &quot;China&quot; is derived from the&nbsp;Persian&nbsp;word&nbsp;Cin&nbsp;(&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;),  which is from theSanskrit&nbsp;word&nbsp;C&nbsp;na&nbsp;(&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;).[23]&nbsp;It  is first recorded in 1516 in the journal of the Portuguese explorer&nbsp;Duarte  Barbosa.[24]&nbsp;The journal was translated and published in England in  1555.[25]&nbsp;The traditional theory, proposed in the 17th century  by&nbsp;Martino Martini, is that&nbsp;C&nbsp;na&nbsp;is derived from  &quot;Qin&quot; (&nbsp;), the westernmost of the Chinese kingdoms during  the&nbsp;Zhou Dynasty.[26]&nbsp;However, the word was used in  early&nbsp;Hinduscripture, including the&nbsp;Mah&nbsp;bh&nbsp;rata&nbsp;(5th  century BC) and the&nbsp;Laws of Manu&nbsp;(2nd century BC).[27][28]<br />
    The official name  of the present country is the People's Republic of China (Chinese:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;;&nbsp;pinyin:&nbsp;Zh&nbsp;nghu&aacute;  R&eacute;nm&iacute;n G&ograve;ngh&eacute;gu&oacute;). The common Chinese names for the country are&nbsp;Zh&nbsp;nggu&oacute;&nbsp;(Chinese:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,  from&nbsp;zh&nbsp;ng, &quot;central&quot; or &quot;middle&quot;, and&nbsp;gu&oacute;,  &quot;state&quot; or &quot;states,&quot; and in modern times,  &quot;nation&quot;) and&nbsp;Zh&nbsp;nghu&aacute;&nbsp;(Chinese:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;),  although the country's official name has been changed numerous times by  successive&nbsp;dynasties&nbsp;and modern governments. The term&nbsp;Zh&nbsp;nggu&oacute;&nbsp;appeared  in various ancient texts, such as the&nbsp;Classic of History&nbsp;of the 6th  century BCE,[j]&nbsp;and in pre-imperial times it was often used as a cultural  concept to distinguish the&nbsp;Huaxia&nbsp;tribes from perceived  &quot;barbarians&quot;. The term, which can be either singular or plural,  referred to the group of states or provinces in the&nbsp;central plain, but was  not used as a name for the country as a whole until the nineteenth century. The  Chinese were not unique in regarding their country as &quot;central&quot;, with  other civilizations having the same view of themselves.[29]<br />

    Prehistory<br />
    Main  article:&nbsp;Chinese prehistory<br />
    Archaeological  evidence suggests that early&nbsp;hominids&nbsp;inhabited China between 250,000  and 2.24 million years ago.[30]&nbsp;A cave in&nbsp;Zhoukoudian&nbsp;(near  present-day Beijing) exhibits hominid fossils dated at between 680,000 and  780,000 BCE.[31]&nbsp;The fossils are of&nbsp;Peking Man, an example  of&nbsp;Homo erectus&nbsp;who&nbsp;used fire.[32]&nbsp;The Peking Man site has  also yielded remains of&nbsp;Homo sapiens&nbsp;dating back to 18,000&ndash;11,000  BCE.[33]&nbsp;Some scholars assert that a form of&nbsp;proto-writing&nbsp;existed  in China as early as 3000 BCE.[34]<br />
    According to  Chinese tradition, the first imperial dynasty was the&nbsp;Xia, which emerged  around 2070 BCE.[35]&nbsp;However, the dynasty was considered mythical by  historians until scientific excavations found early&nbsp;Bronze Age&nbsp;sites  at&nbsp;Erlitou, Henan in 1959.[36]&nbsp;It remains unclear whether these sites  are the remains of the Xia Dynasty or of another culture from the same  period.[37]<br />
    Early dynastic  rule<br />
    Further  information:&nbsp;Dynasties in Chinese history<br />
    The first Chinese  dynasty that left historical records, the loosely  feudal&nbsp;Shang,[38]&nbsp;settled along the&nbsp;Yellow River&nbsp;in eastern  China from the 17th to the 11th century BCE.[39]&nbsp;Theoracle bone  script&nbsp;of the Shang Dynasty represents the oldest form of Chinese writing  yet found,[40]&nbsp;and is a direct ancestor of modern&nbsp;Chinese  characters.[41]&nbsp;The Shang were conquered by the&nbsp;Zhou, who ruled  between the 12th and 5th centuries BCE, until its centralized authority was  slowly eroded by feudal warlords. Many independent states eventually emerged  from the weakened Zhou state and continually waged war with each other in the  300-year&nbsp;Spring and Autumn Period, only occasionally deferring to the Zhou  king. By the time of the&nbsp;Warring States period&nbsp;of the 5th&ndash;3rd  centuries BCE, there were seven powerful sovereign states in what is now China,  each with its own king, ministry and army.<br />
    Imperial China<br />
    The Warring  States period ended in 221 BCE, after the&nbsp;state of Qin&nbsp;conquered the  other six kingdoms and established the first unified Chinese state.&nbsp;Qin  Shi Huang, the emperor of Qin, proclaimed himself the &quot;First Emperor&quot;  (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) and imposed reforms throughout China, notably the forced  standardization of the Chinese language, measurements, length of cart axles,  and currency. The&nbsp;Qin Dynasty&nbsp;lasted only fifteen years, falling soon  after Qin Shi Huang's death, as its harsh&nbsp;legalist&nbsp;and authoritarian  policies led to widespread rebellion.[42][43]</p>
  <p align="left" class="style3">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="left" class="style3">The&nbsp;Great  Wall of China&nbsp;was built by several dynasties over two thousand years to  protect the sedentary agricultural regions of the&nbsp;Chinese  interior&nbsp;from incursions by&nbsp;nomadic&nbsp;pastoralists&nbsp;of the  northern&nbsp;steppes<br />
    The  subsequent&nbsp;Han Dynasty&nbsp;ruled China between 206 BCE and 220 CE, and  created a lasting&nbsp;Han cultural identity&nbsp;among its populace that has  endured to the present day.[42][43]&nbsp;The Han Dynasty&nbsp;expanded the  empire's territory considerablywith military campaigns reaching Korea, Vietnam,  Mongolia and Central Asia, and also helped establish the&nbsp;Silk Road&nbsp;in  Central Asia. Han China gradually became the largest economy of the ancient  world.[44]&nbsp;The Han Dynasty adopted&nbsp;Confucianism, a philosophy  developed in the Spring and Autumn period, as its official state ideology.  Despite the Han's official abandonment of Legalism, the official ideology of  the Qin, Legalist institutions and policies remained and formed the basis of  the Han government.[45]<br />
    After  the&nbsp;collapse of Han, a period of disunion known as the period of  the&nbsp;Three Kingdoms&nbsp;followed.[46]&nbsp;In 581 CE, China was reunited  under the&nbsp;Sui. However, the Sui Dynasty declined following its defeat in  the&nbsp;Goguryeo&ndash;Sui War&nbsp;(598&ndash;614).[47][48]<br />
    Under the  succeeding&nbsp;Tang&nbsp;and&nbsp;Song&nbsp;dynasties, Chinese technology and  culture entered a golden age.[49]&nbsp;The Tang Empire was at its height of  power until the middle of the 8th century, when the&nbsp;An Shi  Rebelliondestroyed the prosperity of the empire.[50]&nbsp;The Song Dynasty was  the first government in world history to issue paper money and the first  Chinese&nbsp;polity&nbsp;to establish a permanent standing navy.[51]&nbsp;Between  the 10th and 11th centuries, the population of China doubled in size to around  100 million people, mostly due to the expansion of rice cultivation in central  and southern China, and the production of abundant food surpluses. The Song  Dynasty also saw a flourishing of philosophy and the arts, as&nbsp;landscape  art&nbsp;and&nbsp;portraitpainting were brought to new levels of maturity and  complexity,[52]&nbsp;and social elites gathered to view art, share their own  and trade precious artworks. The Song Dynasty saw a&nbsp;revival of  Confucianism, in response to the growth of Buddhism during the Tang.[53]</p>

    In the 13th  century, China was&nbsp;gradually conquered by the Mongol empire. In 1271,  theMongol&nbsp;leader&nbsp;Kublai Khan&nbsp;established the&nbsp;Yuan Dynasty;  the Yuan conquered the last remnant of the Song Dynasty in 1279. Before the  Mongol invasion, Song China reportedly consisted of approximately 120 million  citizens; the 1300 census that followed the invasion reported roughly 60  million people.[54]&nbsp;A peasant named&nbsp;Zhu Yuanzhangoverthrew the Yuan  Dynasty in 1368 and founded the&nbsp;Ming Dynasty. Under the Ming Dynasty,  China enjoyed another golden age, developing one of the strongest navies in the  world and a rich and prosperous economy amid a flourishing of art and culture.  It was during this period that&nbsp;Zheng He&nbsp;led&nbsp;explorations  throughout the world, reaching as far as Africa.[55]&nbsp;In the early years of  the Ming Dynasty, China's capital was moved from&nbsp;Nanjingto Beijing. During  the Ming Dynasty, philosophers such as&nbsp;Wang Yangming&nbsp;further  critiqued and expanded Neo-Confucianism with concepts  of&nbsp;individualism&nbsp;and innate morality.[56]<br />
    In 1644, Beijing  was captured by a coalition of rebel forces led by&nbsp;Li Zicheng, a minor  Ming official who led the peasant revolt. The last Ming&nbsp;Chongzhen  Emperor&nbsp;committed suicide when the city fell. The Manchu&nbsp;Qing  Dynasty&nbsp;then allied with Ming Dynasty general&nbsp;Wu Sangui&nbsp;and overthrew  Li's short-lived&nbsp;Shun Dynasty, and subsequently seized control of Beijing,  which became the new capital of the Qing Dynasty.<br />

    The Qing Dynasty,  which lasted from 1644 until 1912, was the last imperial dynasty of China. In  the 19th century, the Qing Dynasty experienced Western imperialism following  two&nbsp;Opium Wars&nbsp;(1839&ndash;42 and 1856&ndash;60) with Britain. China was forced  to sign unequal treaties, pay compensation, allow extraterritoriality for  foreign nationals, and cede&nbsp;Hong Kong&nbsp;to the  British.[57]&nbsp;The&nbsp;First Sino-Japanese War&nbsp;(1894&nbsp;95) resulted  in Qing China's loss of influence in the&nbsp;Korean Peninsula, as well as the  cession of Taiwan to Japan.[58]<br />
    The Qing dynasty  also began experiencing internal unrest in which millions of people died. In  the 1850s and 1860s, the failed&nbsp;Taiping Rebellion&nbsp;ravaged southern  China.&nbsp;Other major rebellions&nbsp;included the&nbsp;Punti&ndash;Hakka Clan  Wars&nbsp;(1855&ndash;67), the&nbsp;Nien Rebellion&nbsp;(1851&ndash;68), the Miao Rebellion  (1854&ndash;73), the&nbsp;Panthay Rebellion&nbsp;(1856&ndash;73) and the&nbsp;Dungan  revolt&nbsp;(1862&ndash;77).<br />
    In the 19th  century, the great&nbsp;Chinese Diaspora&nbsp;began. Emigration rates were  strengthened by conflicts and catastrophes such as the&nbsp;Northern Chinese  Famine of 1876&ndash;1879, which claimed between 9 and 13 million lives in northern  China.[59]&nbsp;In 1898, theGuangxu Emperor&nbsp;drafted a&nbsp;reform  plan&nbsp;to establish a modern&nbsp;constitutional monarchy, but he was  overthrown by the&nbsp;Empress Dowager Cixi&nbsp;in a coup d'&eacute;tat. The  ill-fated anti-Western&nbsp;Boxer Rebellion&nbsp;of 1899&ndash;1901 further weakened  the Qing Dynasty. TheXinhai Revolution&nbsp;of 1911&ndash;12 brought an end to the  Qing Dynasty and established the&nbsp;Republic of China.<br />

  <p align="left" class="style3">Sun Yat-sen, the  father of modern China (seated on right), andChiang Kai-shek,  later&nbsp;President of the Republic of China<br />
    On 1 January  1912, the Republic of China was established, and&nbsp;Sun Yat-sen&nbsp;of  the&nbsp;Kuomintang(the KMT or Nationalist Party) was proclaimed provisional  president.[60]&nbsp;However, the presidency was later given to&nbsp;Yuan  Shikai, a former Qing general, who in 1915 proclaimed himself&nbsp;Emperor of  China. In the face of popular condemnation and opposition from his ownBeiyang  Army, he was forced to abdicate and reestablish the republic.[61]<br />
    After Yuan  Shikai's death in 1916, China was politically fragmented. Its Beijing-based  government was internationally recognized but virtually powerless; regional  warlords controlled most of its territory.[62][63]&nbsp;In the late 1920s, the  Kuomintang, under&nbsp;Chiang Kai-shek, was able to reunify the country under  its own control with a series of deft military and political maneuverings,  known collectively as the&nbsp;Northern Expedition.[64][65]&nbsp;The Kuomintang  moved the nation's capital to&nbsp;Nanjing&nbsp;and implemented &quot;political  tutelage&quot;, an intermediate stage of political development outlined in Sun  Yat-sen's&nbsp;San-min&nbsp;program for transforming China into a modern  democratic state.[66][67]&nbsp;The&nbsp;political division&nbsp;in China made  it difficult for Chiang to battle the&nbsp;Communists, against whom the  Kuomintang had been warring since 1927 in theChinese Civil War. This war  continued successfully for the Kuomintang, especially after the Communists retreated  in the&nbsp;Long March, until Japanese aggression and the 1936&nbsp;Xi'an  Incidentforced Chiang to confront&nbsp;Imperial Japan.[68]<br />
    The&nbsp;Second  Sino-Japanese War&nbsp;(1937&ndash;1945), a theater of&nbsp;World War II, forced an  uneasy alliance between the Kuomintang and the Communists. Japanese forces  committed numerous&nbsp;war atrocities&nbsp;against the civilian population; in  all, as many as 20 million Chinese civilians died.[69]&nbsp;An estimated  200,000 Chinese&nbsp;were massacred&nbsp;in the city of Nanjing alone during the  Japanese occupation.[70]&nbsp;Japan unconditionally surrendered to China in  1945. Taiwan, including the&nbsp;Pescadores, was put under the administrative  control of the Republic of China, which immediately claimed sovereignty. China  emerged victorious but war-ravaged and financially drained. The continued  distrust between the Kuomintang and the Communists led to the resumption of  civil war. In 1947, constitutional rule was established, but because of the  ongoing unrest many provisions of the&nbsp;ROC constitution&nbsp;were never  implemented in mainland China.[71]<br />

  <p align="left" class="style3">Mao  Zedong&nbsp;proclaiming the establishment of the PRC in 1949<br />
    Major combat in  the&nbsp;Chinese Civil War&nbsp;ended in 1949 with the Communist Party in  control of most of&nbsp;mainland China, and the Kuomintang retreating offshore,  reducing the ROC's territory to only&nbsp;Taiwan, Hainan, their surrounding  islands. On 1 October 1949,Communist Party Chairman&nbsp;Mao  Zedong&nbsp;proclaimed the establishment of the People's Republic of  China.[72]&nbsp;In 1950, the&nbsp;People's Liberation Army&nbsp;succeeded  in&nbsp;capturing Hainan&nbsp;from the ROC[73]&nbsp;and  occupying&nbsp;Tibet.[74]&nbsp;However, remaining Nationalist forces continued  to wage&nbsp;an insurgency in western China&nbsp;throughout the 1950s.[75]<br />
    Mao encouraged  population growth, and under his leadership the Chinese population almost  doubled from around 550 million to over 900 million.[76]&nbsp;However,  Mao's&nbsp;Great Leap Forward, a large-scale economic and social reform  project, resulted in&nbsp;an estimated 45&nbsp;million deaths&nbsp;between 1958  and 1961, mostly from starvation.[77]&nbsp;Between 1 and 2  million&nbsp;landlords&nbsp;were executed as  &quot;counterrevolutionaries.&quot;[78]&nbsp;In 1966, Mao and his allies  launched the&nbsp;Cultural Revolution, sparking a period of political  recrimination and social upheaval which lasted until Mao's death in 1976. In  October 1971, the PRC&nbsp;replaced the Republic of China&nbsp;in the United  Nations, and took its seat as a permanent member of the Security Council.[79]<br />
    After Mao's death  in 1976 and the arrest of the faction known as the&nbsp;Gang of Four, who were  blamed for the excesses of the Cultural Revolution,&nbsp;Deng  Xiaoping&nbsp;took power and led the country to&nbsp;significant economic  reforms. The Communist Party subsequently loosened governmental control over  citizens' personal lives and the&nbsp;communes&nbsp;were disbanded in favor of  private land leases. This turn of events marked China's transition from a  planned economy to a mixed economy with an&nbsp;increasingly open market  environment.[80]&nbsp;China adopted its current&nbsp;constitution&nbsp;on 4 December  1982. In 1989, the&nbsp;violent suppression&nbsp;of&nbsp;student protests in  Tiananmen Square&nbsp;brought condemnation and sanctions against the Chinese  government from various countries.[81]</p>

    President&nbsp;Jiang  Zemin&nbsp;and&nbsp;Premier&nbsp;Zhu Rongji&nbsp;led the nation in the 1990s.  Under their administration, China's economic performance pulled an estimated  150&nbsp;million peasants out of poverty and sustained an average annual gross  domestic product growth rate of 11.2%.[82][83]&nbsp;The country formally joined  the&nbsp;World Trade Organization&nbsp;in 2001, and maintained its high rate of  economic growth under&nbsp;Hu Jintao's presidency in the 2000s. However, rapid  growth also severely impacted the country's resources and  environment,[84][85]&nbsp;and caused&nbsp;major social displacement.[86][87]&nbsp;Living  standards continued to improve rapidly despite the&nbsp;late-2000s recession,  but centralized political control remained tight.[88]<br />
    Preparations for  a decadal Communist Party leadership change in 2012 were marked byfactional  disputes and political scandals.[89]&nbsp;During China's&nbsp;18th National  Communist Party Congress&nbsp;in November 2012, Hu Jintao and&nbsp;Wen  Jiabao&nbsp;were replaced as President and Premier by&nbsp;Xi  Jinping&nbsp;and&nbsp;Li Keqiang, who formally took office in 2013.[90][91]&nbsp;Under  Xi, the Chinese government began large-scale efforts to reform its  economy,[92][93]which has suffered from structural instabilities and slowing  growth.[94][95][96][97]&nbsp;Xi's administration also announced major reforms  to the&nbsp;one-child policy&nbsp;and prison system.[98]<br />

  <p align="left" class="style3">The People's  Republic of China is the&nbsp;second-largest&nbsp;country in the world by land  area[99]&nbsp;afterRussia, and is either the&nbsp;third- or  fourth-largest&nbsp;by total area, after Russia, Canada and, depending on the  definition of total area, the United States.[k]&nbsp;China's total area is  generally stated as being approximately 9,600,000&nbsp;km2&nbsp;(3,700,000&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi).[100]&nbsp;Specific  area figures range from 9,572,900&nbsp;km2&nbsp;(3,696,100&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi)  according to the&nbsp;Encyclop&aelig;dia  Britannica,[101]9,596,961&nbsp;km2&nbsp;(3,705,407&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi) according  to the UN Demographic Yearbook,[5]&nbsp;to  9,596,961&nbsp;km2&nbsp;(3,705,407&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi) according to the&nbsp;CIA  World Factbook.[7]<br />
    China has  the&nbsp;longest combined land border in the world, measuring 22,117&nbsp;km  (13,743&nbsp;mi) from the mouth of the&nbsp;Yalu River&nbsp;to the&nbsp;Gulf of  Tonkin.[7]&nbsp;China&nbsp;borders 14 nations,&nbsp;more than any other  country&nbsp;except Russia, which also borders 14.[102]&nbsp;China extends  across much of East Asia, bordering&nbsp;Vietnam,&nbsp;Laos,  and&nbsp;Burma&nbsp;in Southeast  Asia;&nbsp;India,&nbsp;Bhutan,&nbsp;Nepal&nbsp;andPakistan[l]&nbsp;in South  Asia;&nbsp;Afghanistan,&nbsp;Tajikistan,&nbsp;Kyrgyzstan&nbsp;and&nbsp;Kazakhstan&nbsp;in  Central Asia; and&nbsp;Russia,&nbsp;Mongolia, and&nbsp;North Korea&nbsp;in&nbsp;Inner  Asia&nbsp;and&nbsp;Northeast Asia.

    Landscape and  climate</p>
  <p align="left" class="style3">The&nbsp;South  China Sea&nbsp;coast atHainan<br />
    The territory of  China lies between&nbsp;latitudes&nbsp;18&deg;&nbsp;and&nbsp;54&deg; N,  and&nbsp;longitudes&nbsp;73&deg;&nbsp;and&nbsp;135&deg; E. China's landscapes vary  significantly across its vast width. In the east, along the shores of  the&nbsp;Yellow Sea&nbsp;and the&nbsp;East China Sea, there are extensive and  densely populated&nbsp;alluvial plains, while on the edges of the Inner  Mongolian plateau in the north, broadgrasslands&nbsp;predominate. Southern  China is dominated by hills and low mountain ranges, while the central-east  hosts the&nbsp;deltas&nbsp;of China's two major rivers, the&nbsp;Yellow  River&nbsp;and the&nbsp;Yangtze River. Other major rivers include  the&nbsp;Xi,&nbsp;Mekong,&nbsp;Brahmaputra&nbsp;and&nbsp;Amur. To the west sit  major mountain ranges, most notably the Himalayas.  High&nbsp;plateaus&nbsp;feature among the more arid landscapes of the north,  such as the&nbsp;Taklamakan&nbsp;and the&nbsp;Gobi Desert. The world's highest  point,&nbsp;Mount Everest&nbsp;(8,848m), lies on the Sino-Nepalese  border.[103]The country's lowest point, and the world's third-lowest, is the  dried lake bed of&nbsp;Ayding Lake&nbsp;(&nbsp;154m) in the&nbsp;Turpan  Depression.[104]<br />
    China's climate  is mainly dominated by&nbsp;dry seasons&nbsp;and wet&nbsp;monsoons, which lead  to pronounced temperature differences between winter and summer. In the winter,  northern winds coming from high-latitude areas are cold and dry; in summer,  southern winds from coastal areas at lower latitudes are warm and moist.[105]&nbsp;The  climate in China differs from region to region because of the country's highly  complex&nbsp;topography.<br />
    A major  environmental issue in China is the continued&nbsp;expansion of its deserts,  particularly the Gobi Desert.[106][107]&nbsp;Although barrier tree lines planted  since the 1970s have reduced the frequency of&nbsp;sandstorms, prolonged  drought and poor agricultural practices have resulted in&nbsp;dust  storms&nbsp;plaguing northern China each spring, which then spread to other  parts of East Asia, including Korea and Japan. According to China's  environmental watchdog, Sepa, China is losing a million acres (4,000&nbsp;km&sup2;)  per year to desertification.[108]&nbsp;Water quality,&nbsp;erosion,  and&nbsp;pollution control&nbsp;have become important issues in China's  relations with other countries. Melting&nbsp;glaciers&nbsp;in the Himalayas  could potentially lead to&nbsp;water shortages&nbsp;for hundreds of millions of  people.[109]<br />

    China is one of  17&nbsp;megadiverse countries,[110]&nbsp;lying in two of the world's  major&nbsp;ecozones: the&nbsp;Palearctic&nbsp;and the&nbsp;Indomalaya. By one  measure, China has over 34,687 species of animals and vascular plants, making  it the third-most biodiverse country in the world,  afterBrazil&nbsp;and&nbsp;Colombia.[111]&nbsp;The country signed the&nbsp;Rio  de Janeiro&nbsp;Convention on Biological Diversity&nbsp;on 11 June 1992, and  became a party to the convention on 5 January 1993.[112]It later produced a&nbsp;National  Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan, with one revision that was received by  the convention on 21 September 2010.[113]<br />
    China is home to  at least 551 species of&nbsp;mammals&nbsp;(the third-highest such number in the  world),[114]&nbsp;1,221 species of birds (eighth),[115]&nbsp;424 species of  reptiles (seventh)[116]&nbsp;and 333 species of amphibians  (seventh).[117]&nbsp;China is the most biodiverse country in each category  outside of the tropics. Wildlife in China share habitat with and bear acute  pressure from the world's largest population of&nbsp;homo sapiens. At least  840&nbsp;animal species are threatened, vulnerable or in danger of local  extinction&nbsp;in China, due mainly to human activity such as habitat  destruction, pollution and poaching for food, fur and ingredients  for&nbsp;traditional Chinese medicine.[118]&nbsp;Endangered wildlife is  protected by law, and as of 2005, the country has over 2,349&nbsp;nature  reserves, covering a total area of 149.95 million hectares, 15 percent of  China's total land area.[119]<br />
    China has over  32,000 species of vascular plants,[120]&nbsp;and is home to a variety of forest  types. Cold&nbsp;coniferous&nbsp;forests predominate in the north of the  country, supporting animal species such as&nbsp;moose&nbsp;and&nbsp;Asian black  bear, along with over 120 bird species.[121]&nbsp;The understorey of moist&nbsp;conifer&nbsp;forests  may contain thickets of&nbsp;bamboo. In higher montane stands  of&nbsp;juniper&nbsp;and&nbsp;yew, the bamboo is replaced  by&nbsp;rhododendrons.&nbsp;Subtropical&nbsp;forests, which are predominate in  central and southern China, support as many as 146,000 species of flora.[121]&nbsp;Tropical  and seasonal&nbsp;rainforests, though confined  to&nbsp;Yunnan&nbsp;and&nbsp;Hainan Island, contain a quarter of all the animal  and plant species found in China.[121]&nbsp;China has over 10,000 recorded  species of&nbsp;fungi,[122]&nbsp;and of them, nearly 6,000 arehigher  fungi.[123]<br />

    In recent  decades, China has suffered from&nbsp;severe environmental deterioration and  pollution.[124][125]&nbsp;While regulations such as the 1979 Environmental  Protection Law are fairly stringent, they are poorly enforced, as they are  frequently disregarded by local communities and government officials in favor  of rapid economic development.[126]&nbsp;Urban air pollution is a severe health  issue in the country; the&nbsp;World Bank&nbsp;estimated in 2013 that 16 of the  world's 20 most-polluted cities are located in China.[127]&nbsp;China is the  world's largest&nbsp;carbon dioxide&nbsp;emitter.[128]&nbsp;The country also  has water problems. Roughly 298&nbsp;million Chinese in rural areas do not have  access to safe drinking water,[129]&nbsp;and 40% of China's rivers had been  polluted by industrial and agricultural waste by late 2011.[130]This crisis is  compounded by increasingly severe water shortages, particularly in the  north-east of the country.[131][132]<br />
    However, China is  the world's leading investor in&nbsp;renewable energy commercialization,  with&nbsp;$52&nbsp;billion invested in 2011 alone;[133][134][135]&nbsp;it is a  major manufacturer of renewable energy technologies and invests heavily in  local-scale renewable energy projects.[136][137]&nbsp;By 2009, over 17% of  China's energy was derived from renewable sources &ndash; most  notably&nbsp;hydroelectric power&nbsp;plants, of which China has a total installed  capacity of 197 GW.[138]&nbsp;In 2011, the Chinese government announced plans  to invest four trillion yuan (US$618.55 billion) in water infrastructure  and&nbsp;desalination&nbsp;projects over a ten-year period, and to complete  construction of a flood prevention and anti-drought system by  2020.[131][139]&nbsp;In 2013, China began a five-year, US$277 billion effort to  reduce air pollution, particularly in the north of the country.[140]<br />

    The People's  Republic of China is one of the world's few remaining&nbsp;socialist states  openly endorsing communism&nbsp;(see&nbsp;Ideology of the Communist Party of  China). The Chinese government has been variously described as communist and  socialist, but also as authoritarian and&nbsp;corporatist,[141]&nbsp;with heavy  restrictions in many areas, most notably against&nbsp;free access to the  Internet,&nbsp;freedom of the press,&nbsp;freedom of assembly,&nbsp;the right  to have children,&nbsp;free formation of social  organizations&nbsp;and&nbsp;freedom of religion.[142]&nbsp;Its current  political and economic system has been termed by its leaders as &quot;socialism  with Chinese characteristics&quot; (which is&nbsp;Marxismadapted to Chinese  circumstances) and as the &quot;socialist market economy&quot;  respectively.[143]<br />
    The country is  ruled by the&nbsp;Communist Party of China&nbsp;(CPC), whose power is enshrined  in&nbsp;China's constitution.[144]&nbsp;The&nbsp;Chinese electoral  system&nbsp;is hierarchical, whereby local People's Congresses  are&nbsp;directly elected, and all higher levels of People's Congresses up to  the&nbsp;National People's Congress&nbsp;(NPC) are&nbsp;indirectly elected&nbsp;by  the People's Congress of the level immediately below.[145]&nbsp;The political  system is decentralized, and provincial and sub-provincial leaders have a  significant amount of autonomy.[146]&nbsp;There are&nbsp;other political  parties in China, referred to in China as democratic parties, which participate  in the National People's Congress and the&nbsp;Chinese People's Political  Consultative Conference&nbsp;(CPPCC).[147]</p>

    Compared to its  closed-door policies until the mid-1970s, the liberalization of China has  resulted in the administrative climate being less restrictive than before.  China supports the Leninist principle of &quot;democratic  centralism&quot;,[148]&nbsp;but the elected National People's Congress has been  described as a &quot;rubber stamp&quot; body.[149]&nbsp;The  incumbent&nbsp;President&nbsp;is&nbsp;Xi Jinping, who is also the&nbsp;General  Secretary of the Communist Party of China&nbsp;and the&nbsp;Chairman&nbsp;of  the&nbsp;Central Military Commission.[90]The  current&nbsp;Premier&nbsp;is&nbsp;Li Keqiang, who is also a senior member of  the&nbsp;CPC Politburo Standing Committee.<br />
    There have been  some moves toward political liberalization, in that open contested elections  are now held at the village and town levels.[150][151]&nbsp;However, the Party  retains effective control over government appointments: in the absence of  meaningful opposition, the CPC wins by default most of the time. Political  concerns in China include the growing gap between rich and poor and government  corruption.[152][153]&nbsp;Nonetheless, the level of public support for the  government and its management of the nation is high, with 80&ndash;95% of Chinese  citizens expressing satisfaction with the central government, according to a  2011 survey.[154]<br />

    The People's  Republic of China has administrative control over 22&nbsp;provinces&nbsp;and  considers&nbsp;Taiwan&nbsp;to be&nbsp;its 23rd province, althoughTaiwan&nbsp;is  currently and independently governed by the Republic of China, which disputes  the PRC's claim.[155]&nbsp;China also has five subdivisions officially  termed&nbsp;autonomous regions, each with a designated minority group;  four&nbsp;municipalities; and two&nbsp;Special Administrative Regions&nbsp;(SARs),  which enjoy a degree of political autonomy. These 22 provinces, five autonomous  regions, and four municipalities can be collectively referred to as  &quot;mainland China&quot;, a term which usually excludes the SARs of&nbsp;Hong  Kong&nbsp;andMacau. None of these divisions are recognized by the ROC government,  which claims the entirety of the PRC's territory.<br />

    The PRC has  diplomatic relations with 171 countries and maintains&nbsp;embassies in  162.[156]&nbsp;Its&nbsp;legitimacy&nbsp;is disputed by the Republic of China  and a few other countries; it is thus the largest and most populous&nbsp;state  with limited recognition. In 1971, the PRC replaced the Republic of China as  the sole representative of China in the United Nations and as one of the five  permanent members of the&nbsp;United Nations Security Council.[157]China was  also a former member and leader of the&nbsp;Non-Aligned Movement, and still  considers itself an advocate for&nbsp;developing countries.[158]&nbsp;Along  with Brazil, Russia, India and South Africa, China is a member of  the&nbsp;BRICS&nbsp;group of emerging major economies and hosted the  group's&nbsp;third official summit&nbsp;at&nbsp;Sanya,&nbsp;Hainan&nbsp;in  April 2011.[159]<br />
    Under its  interpretation of the&nbsp;One-China policy, Beijing has made it a precondition  to establishing diplomatic relations that the other country acknowledges its  claim to Taiwan and severs official ties with the government of the Republic of  China. Chinese officials have protested on numerous occasions when foreign  countries have made diplomatic overtures to Taiwan,[160]&nbsp;especially in the  matter of armament sales.[161]&nbsp;Political meetings between foreign  government officials and the&nbsp;14th Dalai Lama&nbsp;are also opposed by  China, as the latter considers Tibet to be formally part of China.[162]<br />
    Much of current  Chinese foreign policy is reportedly based on&nbsp;Zhou Enlai's&nbsp;Five  Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and is also driven by the concept of  &quot;harmony without uniformity&quot;, which encourages diplomatic relations  between states despite ideological differences.[163]&nbsp;This policy may have  led China to support states that are&nbsp;regarded as dangerous&nbsp;or  repressive by Western nations, such as&nbsp;Zimbabwe, North Korea and&nbsp;Iran.[164]&nbsp;China  has a close economic and military relationship with Russia,[165]&nbsp;and the  two states often vote in unison in the UN Security Council.[166][167][168]</p>

In 2004, it  proposed an entirely newEast Asia Summit&nbsp;(EAS) framework as a forum for  regional security issues.[169]&nbsp;The EAS, which includes&nbsp;ASEAN Plus  Three, India, Australia and New Zealand, held its inaugural summit in 2005.  China is also a founding member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO),  along with Russia and the Central Asian republics. China became a member of the  World Trade Organization (WTO) on 11 December 2001.<br />
    In 2000,  the&nbsp;United States Congress&nbsp;approved &quot;permanent normal trade  relations&quot; (PNTR) with China, allowing Chinese exports in at the same low  tariffs as goods from most other countries.[170]&nbsp;China has a significant&nbsp;trade  surplus&nbsp;with the United States, its most important export  market.[171]&nbsp;In the early 2010s, US politicians argued that  the&nbsp;Chinese yuan&nbsp;was significantly undervalued, giving China an  unfair trade advantage.[172][173][174]&nbsp;In recent decades, China has  followed a policy of&nbsp;engaging with African nations&nbsp;for trade and  bilateral co-operation;[175][176][177]&nbsp;in 2012, Sino-African trade  totalled over US$160 billion.[178]&nbsp;China has furthermore strengthened its  ties with major South American economies, becoming the largest trading partner  of Brazil and building strategic links with&nbsp;Argentina.[179][180]<br />

    In addition to  claiming all of Taiwan, China has been involved in a number of other  international territorial disputes. Since the 1990s, China has been involved in  negotiations to resolve its disputed land borders, including a&nbsp;disputed  border with India&nbsp;and an undefined border with&nbsp;Bhutan. China is  additionally involved in multilateral disputes over the ownership of several  small islands in the East and South China Seas, such as theSenkaku  Islands&nbsp;and the&nbsp;Scarborough Shoal.[181][182]<br />
    Emerging  superpower status<br />
    China is  regularly hailed as a&nbsp;potential new superpower, with certain commentators  citing its rapid economic progress, growing military might, very large  population, and increasing international influence as signs that it will play  a&nbsp;prominent global role&nbsp;in the&nbsp;21st  century.[20][183]&nbsp;Others, however, warn that&nbsp;economic  bubbles&nbsp;and demographic imbalances could slow or even halt China's growth  as the century progresses.[184][185]&nbsp;Some authors also question the  definition of &quot;superpower&quot;, arguing that China's large economy alone  would not qualify it as a superpower, and noting that it lacks the military and  cultural influence of the United States.[186]<br />

    The&nbsp;Chinese  democracy movement, social activists, and some members of the Communist Party  of China have all identified the need for social and political reform. While  economic and social controls have been significantly relaxed in China since the  1970s,political freedom&nbsp;is still tightly restricted. The&nbsp;Constitution  of the People's Republic of China&nbsp;states that the &quot;fundamental  rights&quot; of citizens include&nbsp;freedom of speech,&nbsp;freedom of the  press, the&nbsp;right to a fair trial,&nbsp;freedom of religion,&nbsp;universal  suffrage, and&nbsp;property rights. However, in practice, these provisions do  not afford significant protection against criminal prosecution by the  state.[187][188]&nbsp;Censorship of political speech and information, most  notably on the Internet,[189][190]&nbsp;is openly and routinely used in China  to silence criticism of the government and the ruling&nbsp;Communist  Party.[191][192]&nbsp;In 2005,&nbsp;Reporters Without Borders&nbsp;ranked China  159th out of 167 states in its Annual World Press Freedom Index, indicating a  very low level of perceived press freedom.[193]<br />
    Rural migrants to  China's cities often find themselves treated as&nbsp;second-class  citizens&nbsp;by the&nbsp;hukou&nbsp;household registration&nbsp;system, which  controls access to&nbsp;state benefits.[194][195]&nbsp;Property rights are  often poorly protected,[194]&nbsp;and taxation disproportionately affects  poorer citizens.[195]&nbsp;However, a number of rural taxes have been reduced  or abolished since the early 2000s, and additional social services provided to  rural dwellers.[196][197]<br />
    A number of  foreign governments, foreign press agencies and&nbsp;NGOs&nbsp;also routinely  criticize&nbsp;China's human rights record, alleging widespread&nbsp;civil  rights&nbsp;violations such as detention without trial,&nbsp;forced  abortions,[198]&nbsp;forced confessions,&nbsp;torture, restrictions of  fundamental rights,[142][199][200]&nbsp;and&nbsp;excessive use of the death  penalty.[201][202]&nbsp;The government has suppressed demonstrations by  organizations that it considers a potential threat to &quot;social  stability&quot;, as was the case with the&nbsp;Tiananmen Square protests of  1989. The Chinese state is regularly accused of large-scale repression and  human rights abuses in&nbsp;Tibet&nbsp;and&nbsp;Xinjiang, including violent  police crackdowns and&nbsp;religious suppression.[203][204]<br />
    The Chinese  government has responded to foreign criticism by arguing that the notion of  human rights should take into account a country's present level  of&nbsp;economic development&nbsp;and the &quot;people's rights to subsistence  and development&quot;.[205]&nbsp;It emphasizes the rise in the  Chinese&nbsp;standard of living,&nbsp;literacy rate&nbsp;and average&nbsp;life  expectancy&nbsp;since the 1970s, as well as improvements in workplace safety  and efforts to combat natural disasters such as the perennial&nbsp;Yangtze  River&nbsp;floods.[205][206][207]&nbsp;Furthermore, some Chinese politicians  have spoken out in support of democratisation, although&nbsp;others remain more  conservative.[208]&nbsp;Some major reform efforts have been conducted; for an  instance in November 2013, the government announced its plans to the abolish  the much-criticized&nbsp;re-education through  labor&nbsp;program.[98]&nbsp;Although during the 2000s and early 2010s, the  Chinese government was increasingly tolerant of NGOs that offer practical,  efficient solutions to social problems, such &quot;third sector&quot; activity  remained heavily regulated.[209]<br />

    With  2.3&nbsp;million active troops, the People's Liberation Army (PLA) is the  largest standing military force in the world, commanded by the&nbsp;Central  Military Commission&nbsp;(CMC).[210]&nbsp;The PLA consists of the&nbsp;People's  Liberation Army Ground Force&nbsp;(PLAGF), the&nbsp;People's Liberation Army  Navy(PLAN), the&nbsp;People's Liberation Army Air Force&nbsp;(PLAAF), and  a&nbsp;strategicnuclear force, the&nbsp;Second Artillery Corps. According to  the Chinese government, China's military expenditure in 2012 totalled US$100  billion, constituting the&nbsp;world's second-largest military  budget.[211]&nbsp;However, other nations, such as the United States, have  argued that China does not report its real level of military spending, which is  allegedly much higher than the official budget.[212]<br />
    As a  recognized&nbsp;nuclear weapons&nbsp;state, China is considered both a major  regional military power and a&nbsp;potential military  superpower.[213]&nbsp;According to a 2013 report by the&nbsp;US Department of  Defense, China fields between 50 and 75 nuclear&nbsp;ICBMs, along with a number  of&nbsp;SRBMs.[18]&nbsp;However, compared with the other four&nbsp;UN Security  Council&nbsp;Permanent Members, China has a relatively limited&nbsp;power  projection&nbsp;capabilities.[214]&nbsp;To offset this, it has developed  numerous power projection assets &ndash; its&nbsp;first aircraft carrierentered  service in 2012,[215][216][217][218]&nbsp;and it maintains a substantial fleet  of&nbsp;submarines, including  several&nbsp;nuclear-powered&nbsp;attackand&nbsp;ballistic  missile&nbsp;submarines.[219]&nbsp;China has furthermore established  a&nbsp;network of foreign military relationships along critical sea lanes.[220]</p>

    China has made  significant progress in modernizing its air force since the early 2000s,  purchasing Russian fighter jets such as the&nbsp;Sukhoi Su-30, and also  manufacturing its own modern fighters, most notably the&nbsp;Chengdu J-10and  the&nbsp;Shenyang J-11,&nbsp;J-15&nbsp;and&nbsp;J-16.[215][221]&nbsp;China is  furthermore engaged in developing an indigenous&nbsp;stealth aircraft&nbsp;and  numerous&nbsp;combat drones.[222][223][224]&nbsp;China has also updated its  ground forces, replacing its ageing&nbsp;Soviet-derived&nbsp;tank  inventory&nbsp;with numerous variants of the modernType 99&nbsp;tank, and  upgrading its battlefield&nbsp;C3I&nbsp;and&nbsp;C4I&nbsp;systems to enhance  its&nbsp;network-centric warfare&nbsp;capabilities.[225]&nbsp;In addition,  China has developed or acquired numerous advanced missile  systems,[226][227]&nbsp;including&nbsp;anti-satellite  missiles,[228]&nbsp;cruise missiles[229]&nbsp;and submarine-launched nuclear  ICBMs.[230]<br />

    Economic history  and growth<br />
    Main  article:&nbsp;Economic history of China (1949&ndash;present)<br />
    From its founding  in 1949 until late 1978, the People's Republic of China was a Soviet-style  centrally&nbsp;planned economy. Following Mao's death in 1976 and the  consequent end of the&nbsp;Cultural Revolution,&nbsp;Deng Xiaoping&nbsp;and the  new Chinese leadership began to&nbsp;reform the economy&nbsp;and move towards a  more market-oriented&nbsp;mixed economy&nbsp;under one-party rule.&nbsp;Agricultural  collectivization&nbsp;was dismantled and farmlands privatized, while foreign  trade became a major new focus, leading to the creation of&nbsp;Special  Economic Zones&nbsp;(SEZs). Inefficient&nbsp;state-owned enterprises(SOEs) were  restructured and unprofitable ones were closed outright, resulting in massive  job losses. Modern-day China is mainly characterized as having a market economy  based on private property ownership,[232]&nbsp;and is one of the leading  examples of&nbsp;state capitalism.[233][234]&nbsp;The state still dominates in  strategic &quot;pillar&quot; sectors such as energy production and&nbsp;heavy  industries, but private enterprise has expanded enormously, with around  30&nbsp;million private businesses recorded in 2008.[235][236][237][238]</p>

    Since economic  liberalization began in 1978, China has been among the world's fastest-growing  economies,[239]&nbsp;relying largely on investment- and export-led  growth.[240]According to the IMF, China's&nbsp;annual average GDP  growth&nbsp;between 2001 and 2010 was 10.5%. Between 2007 and 2011, China's economic  growth rate was equivalent to all of theG7&nbsp;countries' growth  combined.[241]&nbsp;According to the&nbsp;Global Growth Generators&nbsp;index  announced by&nbsp;Citigroup&nbsp;in February 2011, China has a very high 3G  growth rating.[242]&nbsp;Its high productivity, low labor costs and relatively  good infrastructure have made it a global leader in manufacturing. However, the  Chinese economy is highly energy-intensive and inefficient;[243]&nbsp;China  became the world's largest&nbsp;energy consumer&nbsp;in 2010,[244]&nbsp;relies  on coal to supply over 70% of its energy needs, and surpassed the US to become  the world's largest oil importer in September 2013.[245][246]&nbsp;However,  China's economic growth and industrialization has damaged its environment, and  in the early 2010s, China's economic growth rate began to slow amid domestic  credit troubles&mdash;international demand for Chinese exports has weakened and this  has led to turmoil in the global economy.[247][248][249]<br />
    In the online  realm, China's&nbsp;e-commerce&nbsp;industry has grown more slowly than the EU  and the US, with a significant period of development occurring from around 2009  onwards. According to Credit Suisse, the total value of online transactions in  China grew from an insignificant size in 2008 to around RMB 4 trillion (US$660  billion) in 2012. Alipay has the biggest market share in China with 300 million  users and control of just under half of China's online payment market in  February 2014, while&nbsp;Tenpay's share is around 20 percent, and&nbsp;China  UnionPay's share is slightly greater than 10 percent.[250]</p>

    China was a world  leader in science and technology until the&nbsp;Ming Dynasty.  Ancient&nbsp;Chinese discoveries&nbsp;and&nbsp;inventions, such  as&nbsp;papermaking,&nbsp;printing, the&nbsp;compass,  and&nbsp;gunpowder&nbsp;(the&nbsp;Four Great Inventions), later became  widespread in Asia and Europe. Chinese mathematicians were the first to  use&nbsp;negative numbers.[284][285]&nbsp;However, by the 17th century, the  Western world had surpassed China in scientific and technological  development.[286]&nbsp;The causes of this&nbsp;Great Divergence&nbsp;continue  to be debated.[287]<br />
    After repeated  military defeats by Western nations in the 19th century, Chinese reformers  began promoting modern science and technology as part of  the&nbsp;Self-Strengthening Movement. After the Communists came to power in  1949, efforts were made to organize science and technology based on the model  of the&nbsp;Soviet Union, in which scientific research was part of central  planning.[288]&nbsp;After Mao's death in 1976, science and technology was  established as one of the&nbsp;Four Modernizations,[289]&nbsp;and the Soviet-inspired  academic system was gradually reformed.[290]<br />
    Modern era<br />
    Since the end of  the Cultural Revolution, China has made significant investments in scientific  research,[291]&nbsp;spending over US$100 billion on scientific research and  development in 2011 alone.[292]Science and technology are seen as vital for  achieving economic and political goals, and are held as a source of national  pride to a degree sometimes described as  &quot;techno-nationalism&quot;.[293]&nbsp;While Chinese-born scientists have  won the&nbsp;Nobel Prize in Physics&nbsp;four times and the&nbsp;Nobel Prize in  Chemistry&nbsp;once, these scientists had all earned their doctorates and  conducted their award-winning research in the West.[m]</p>

    Since the late  1990s, China's national road network has been significantly expanded through  the creation of a network of&nbsp;highways, known as the National Trunk Highway  System (NTHS). In 2011 China's highways had reached a total length of  85,000&nbsp;km (53,000&nbsp;mi), making it the longest highway system in the  world.[316]&nbsp;Private car ownership is growing rapidly in China, which  surpassed the United States as the world's largest automobile market in 2009,  with total car sales of over 13.6&nbsp;million.[317]&nbsp;Analysts predict that  annual car sales in China may rise as high as 40 million by 2020.[318]&nbsp;A  side-effect of the rapid growth of China's road network has been a significant  rise in traffic accidents,[319]&nbsp;with poorly enforced traffic laws cited as  a possible cause&mdash;in 2011 alone, around 62,000 Chinese died in road  accidents.[320]&nbsp;In urban areas, bicycles remain a common mode of  transport, despite the increasing prevalence of automobiles &ndash; as of 2012, there  are approximately 470 million bicycles in China.[321]<br />

    Although a  middle-income country by Western standards, China's rapid growth  has&nbsp;pulled hundreds of millions&nbsp;of its people out of poverty since  1978. Today, about 10% of the Chinese population lives below the poverty line  of US$1 per day, down from 64% in 1978. Urban unemployment in China reportedly  declined to 4% by the end of 2007, although true overall unemployment may be as  high as 10%.[334]<br />
    With a population  of over 1.3 billion and dwindling natural resources, the government of China is  very concerned about its population growth rate and has attempted since 1979,  with mixed results,[335]&nbsp;to implement a strict&nbsp;family  planning&nbsp;policy, known as the &quot;one-child policy.&quot; Before 2013,  this policy sought to restrict families to one child each, with exceptions for  ethnic minorities and a degree of flexibility in rural areas. A major loosening  of the policy was enacted in December 2013, allowing families to have two  children if one parent is an only child.[336]&nbsp;China's family planning  minister indicated in 2008 that the one-child policy would be maintained until  at least 2020.[337]&nbsp;The one-child policy is resisted, particularly in  rural areas, primarily because of the need for agricultural labour and a  traditional preference for boys. Families who breach the policy often lie  during the census.[338]&nbsp;Data from the 2010 census implies that  the&nbsp;total fertility rate&nbsp;may now be around 1.4.[339]</p>

    The policy, along  with traditional preference for boys, may be contributing to an imbalance in  the&nbsp;sex ratio&nbsp;at birth.[340][341]&nbsp;According to the 2010 census,  the sex ration at birth was 118.06 boys for every 100 girls,[342]&nbsp;which is  beyond the normal range of around 105 boys for every 100 girls.[343]&nbsp;The  2010 census found that males accounted for 51.27 percent of the total  population.[342]&nbsp;However, China's sex ratio is more balanced than it was  in 1953, when males accounted for 51.82 percent of the total population.[342]<br />

    China officially  recognizes 56 distinct ethnic groups, the largest of which are the&nbsp;Han  Chinese, who constitute about 91.51% of the total population.[9]&nbsp;The Han  Chinese &ndash; the world's largest single ethnic group[344]&nbsp;&ndash; outnumber other  ethnic groups in every provincial-level division  except&nbsp;Tibet&nbsp;and&nbsp;Xinjiang.[345]&nbsp;Ethnic minorities account  for about 8.49% of the population of China, according to the 2010  census.[9]&nbsp;Compared with the 2000 population census, the Han population  increased by 66,537,177 persons, or 5.74%, while the population of the 55  national minorities combined increased by 7,362,627 persons, or  6.92%.[9]&nbsp;The 2010 census recorded a total of 593,832 foreign citizens  living in China. The largest such groups were from South Korea (120,750), the  United States (71,493) and Japan (66,159).[346]<br />

    The languages  most spoken in China belong to the&nbsp;Sino-Tibetan language&nbsp;family.  There are also several major&nbsp;linguistic groups&nbsp;within the Chinese  language itself. The most spoken varieties are&nbsp;Mandarin&nbsp;(spoken by  70% of the  population),[347]&nbsp;Wu&nbsp;(includingShanghainese),&nbsp;Yue&nbsp;(including&nbsp;Cantonese&nbsp;and&nbsp;Taishanese),&nbsp;Min&nbsp;(including&nbsp;Hokkien&nbsp;andTeochew),&nbsp;Xiang,&nbsp;Gan,  and&nbsp;Hakka. Non-Sinitic languages spoken widely by ethnic minorities  include&nbsp;Zhuang,&nbsp;Mongolian,&nbsp;Tibetan,&nbsp;Uyghur,&nbsp;Hmong&nbsp;and&nbsp;Korean.[348]&nbsp;Standard  Mandarin, a variety of Mandarin based on the&nbsp;Beijing dialect, is the  official national language of China and is used as a&nbsp;lingua franca&nbsp;in  the country between people of different linguistic backgrounds.[349]<br />
    Classical  Chinese&nbsp;was the written standard in China for thousands of years and  allowed for written communication between speakers of various unintelligible  languages and dialects in China.&nbsp;Written vernacular Chinese,  or&nbsp;baihua, is the written standard, based on the Mandarin dialect and  first popularized in Ming Dynasty novels. It was adopted, with significant  modifications, during the early 20th century as the national standard.  Classical Chinese is still part of the high school curriculum, and is thus  intelligible to some degree to many Chinese. Since their promulgation by the  government in 1956,&nbsp;Simplified Chinese characters&nbsp;have become the  official standardized&nbsp;written script&nbsp;used to&nbsp;write the Chinese  language&nbsp;within mainland China, supplanting the use of the  earlier&nbsp;Traditional Chinese characters.<br />
    Urbanization<br />

    China has  urbanized significantly in the past few decades. The percent of the country's  population living in urban areas increased from 20% in 1990 to 46% in  2007.[350]&nbsp;It is estimated that China's urban population will reach one  billion by 2030.[350]&nbsp;As of 2012, there are more than  262&nbsp;million&nbsp;migrant workers&nbsp;in China.[351]&nbsp;Most of them are  from rural areas and seek work in the cities.<br />
    China has over  160 cities with a population of over one million,[352]&nbsp;including the  seven&nbsp;megacities&nbsp;(cities with a population of over 10 million) of  Chongqing, Shanghai, Beijing, Guangzhou, Tianjin, Shenzhen, and  Wuhan.[353][354][355]&nbsp;By 2025, it is estimated that the country will be  home to 221 cities with over a million inhabitants.[350]&nbsp;The figures in  the table below are from the 2010 census,[3]&nbsp;and are only estimates of the  urban populations within administrative city limits; a different ranking exists  when considering the total municipal populations (which includes suburban and  rural populations).

    Since 1986,  compulsory education in China comprises&nbsp;primary&nbsp;and&nbsp;junior  secondary school, which together last for nine years.[358]&nbsp;In 2010, about  82.5 percent of students continued their education at a three-year senior  secondary school.[359]&nbsp;The&nbsp;Gaokao, China's national university  entrance exam, is a prerequisite for entrance into most higher education  institutions. In 2010, 27 percent of secondary school graduates are enrolled in  higher education.[360]&nbsp;Vocational education is available to students at  the secondary andtertiary&nbsp;level.[361]<br />
    In February 2006,  the government pledged to provide completely free nine-year education,  including textbooks and fees.[362]&nbsp;Annual education investment went from  less than US$50 billion in 2003 to more than US$250 billion in  2011.[363]&nbsp;However, there remains an inequality in education spending. In  2010, the annual education expenditure per secondary school student in Beijing  totaled &yen;20,023, while in&nbsp;Guizhou, one of the&nbsp;poorest provinces in  China, only totaled &yen;3,204.[364]&nbsp;Free compulsory education in China  consists of primary school and junior secondary school between the ages of 6  and 15. In 2011, around 81.4% of Chinese have received secondary  education.[365]&nbsp;By 2007, there were 396,567 primary schools, 94,116  secondary schools, and 2,236 higher education institutions in China.[366]<br />
    As of 2010, 94%  of the population over age 15 are literate,[367]&nbsp;compared to only 20% in  1950.[368]&nbsp;In 2009, Chinese students from Shanghai achieved the world's  best results in mathematics, science and literacy, as tested by  the&nbsp;Programme for International Student Assessment&nbsp;(PISA), a  worldwide evaluation of 15-year-old school pupils' scholastic performance.[369]<br />

    The&nbsp;Ministry  of Health, together with its counterparts in the provincial health bureaux,  oversees the health needs of the Chinese population.[370]&nbsp;An emphasis on  public health and preventive medicine has characterized Chinese health policy  since the early 1950s. At that time, the Communist Party started  the&nbsp;Patriotic Health Campaign, which was aimed at improving sanitation and  hygiene, as well as treating and preventing several diseases. Diseases such  as&nbsp;cholera,&nbsp;typhoid&nbsp;and&nbsp;scarlet fever, which were  previously rife in China, were nearly eradicated by the campaign. After Deng  Xiaoping began instituting economic reforms in 1978, the health of the Chinese  public improved rapidly due to better nutrition, although many of the free  public health services provided in the countryside disappeared along with the  People's Communes. Healthcare in China became mostlyprivatized, and experienced  a significant rise in quality. In 2009, the government began a 3-year  large-scale healthcare provision initiative worth US$124 billion.[371]&nbsp;By  2011, the campaign resulted in 95% of China's population having basic health  insurance coverage.[372]&nbsp;In 2011, China was estimated to be the world's  third-largest supplier of&nbsp;pharmaceuticals, but its population has suffered  from the development and distribution of&nbsp;counterfeit medications.[373]<br />
    Life expectancy  at birth in China is 75 years,[374]&nbsp;and the&nbsp;infant mortality&nbsp;rate  is 12 per thousand.[375]&nbsp;Both have improved significantly since the  1950s.[n]&nbsp;Rates of&nbsp;stunting, a condition caused by&nbsp;malnutrition,  have declined from 33.1% in 1990 to 9.9% in 2010.[378]&nbsp;Despite significant  improvements in health and the construction of advanced medical facilities,  China has several emerging public health problems, such as respiratory  illnesses caused by&nbsp;widespread air pollution,[379]&nbsp;hundreds of  millions of&nbsp;cigarette smokers,[380]&nbsp;and an increase in&nbsp;obesity&nbsp;among  urban youths.[381][382]&nbsp;China's large population and densely populated  cities have led to serious disease outbreaks in recent years, such as the 2003  outbreak of&nbsp;SARS, although this has since been largely  contained.[383]&nbsp;In 2010, air pollution caused 1.2 million premature deaths  in China.[384]<br />

    Freedom of  religion&nbsp;is guaranteed by China's constitution, although religious  organizations that lack official approval can be subject to state  persecution.[199][385]&nbsp;Estimates of religious demographics in China vary.  A 2007 survey found that 31.4 percent of Chinese above the age of 16 were  religious,[386]&nbsp;while a 2006 study found that 46% of the Chinese  population were religious.[387]<br />
    Over the  millennia, the Chinese civilization has been influenced by various religious  movements. China's&nbsp;San Jiao&nbsp;(&quot;three doctrines&quot; or  &quot;three religions&quot;) include&nbsp;Confucianism,[o]&nbsp;Buddhism,  andTaoism, and historically have had a significant impact in shaping Chinese  culture.[389][390]Elements of these three belief systems are often incorporated  into&nbsp;popular or folk religious traditions.[391]&nbsp;A 2008 survey of  rural villagers in six provinces found that<br />
    more than  two-thirds of self-proclaimed religious believers (or 31.09% of all sample  villagers) do not or cannot clearly identify their faith&nbsp;... These people  believe that there are supernatural powers that dominate or strongly influence  the fate of human beings, and they think their fates can be changed through  offering sacrifices to gods or ancestors. These beliefs and practices are often  deeply rooted in traditional Chinese cultures and customs of local  communities.[387]<br />
    A 2007 survey by  the Horizon Research Consultancy Group found that individuals who self-identify  as Buddhists made up 11&ndash;16% of China's adult population,  while&nbsp;Christians&nbsp;comprised around 3&ndash;4%,  and&nbsp;Muslims&nbsp;comprised approximately 1%.[392]&nbsp;Some of the&nbsp;ethnic  minorities of China&nbsp;practice unique&nbsp;ethnic  religions&nbsp;&ndash;Dongbaism&nbsp;is the traditional religion of the&nbsp;Nakhi  people,&nbsp;Moism&nbsp;that of the&nbsp;Zhuang people,  and&nbsp;Ruism&nbsp;that of the&nbsp;Qiang people. The traditional indigenous  religion of&nbsp;Tibet&nbsp;is&nbsp;B&ouml;n, while  most&nbsp;Tibetans&nbsp;follow&nbsp;Tibetan Buddhism, a form  of&nbsp;Vajrayana.[393]<br />

    Since ancient  times, Chinese culture has been heavily influenced  by&nbsp;Confucianism&nbsp;and conservative philosophies. For much of the  country's dynastic era, opportunities for social advancement could be provided  by high performance in the prestigious&nbsp;imperial examinations, which have  their origins in the&nbsp;Han Dynasty.[394]&nbsp;The&nbsp;literary  emphasis&nbsp;of the exams affected the general perception of cultural  refinement in China, such as the belief  that&nbsp;calligraphy,&nbsp;poetry&nbsp;and&nbsp;painting&nbsp;were higher  forms of art than dancing or drama. Chinese culture has long emphasized a sense  of deep history and a largely inward-looking national  perspective.[20]&nbsp;Examinations and a&nbsp;culture of merit&nbsp;remain  greatly valued in China today.[395]<br />
    The first leaders  of the People's Republic of China were born into the traditional imperial  order, but were influenced by the&nbsp;May Fourth Movement&nbsp;and reformist  ideals. They sought to change some traditional aspects of Chinese culture, such  as rural land tenure,&nbsp;sexism, and the Confucian system of education, while  preserving others, such as the family structure and culture of obedience to the  state. Some observers see the period following the establishment of the PRC in  1949 as a continuation of traditional Chinese dynastic history, while others  claim that the Communist Party's rule has damaged the foundations of Chinese  culture, especially through political movements such as the&nbsp;Cultural  Revolution&nbsp;of the 1960s, where many aspects of traditional culture were  destroyed, having been denounced as &quot;regressive and harmful&quot; or  &quot;vestiges of&nbsp;feudalism&quot;. Many important aspects of traditional  Chinese morals and culture, such as Confucianism, art, literature, and  performing arts like&nbsp;Peking opera,[396]&nbsp;were altered to conform to  government policies and propaganda at the time. Access to foreign media remains  heavily restricted; only&nbsp;34 foreign films&nbsp;a year are allowed to be  shown in Chinese cinemas.[397]<br />
    Today, the  Chinese government has accepted numerous elements of traditional Chinese  culture as being integral to Chinese society. With the rise of&nbsp;Chinese  nationalism&nbsp;and the end of the Cultural Revolution, various forms of  traditional Chinese art, literature, music, film, fashion and architecture have  seen a vigorous revival,[398][399]&nbsp;and folk and variety art in particular  have sparked interest nationally and even worldwide.[400]&nbsp;China is now  the&nbsp;third-most-visited country in the world,[401]&nbsp;with  55.7&nbsp;million inbound international visitors in 2010.[402]&nbsp;It also  experiences an enormous volume of&nbsp;domestic tourism; an estimated 740 million  Chinese holidaymakers travelled within the country in October 2012 alone.[403]</p>

    Chinese cuisine  is highly diverse, drawing on several millennia of culinary history. The  dynastic&nbsp;emperors&nbsp;of ancient China were known to have many dining  chambers in their palaces, with each chamber divided into several departments,  each responsible for a specific type of dish.[404]&nbsp;China's staple food is  rice. Pork is the most popular meat in China, accounting for about  three-fourths of the country's total meat consumption.[405]Spices&nbsp;are  central to Chinese cuisine. Numerous foreign offshoots of Chinese food, such  as&nbsp;Hong Kong cuisine&nbsp;and&nbsp;American Chinese food, have emerged in  the various nations that play host to the&nbsp;Chinese diaspora.<br />

    China has one of  the&nbsp;oldest sporting cultures&nbsp;in the world. There is evidence that a  form ofassociation football&nbsp;called&nbsp;cuju&nbsp;was played in China  during the Han Dynasty.[406]&nbsp;Today, some of the most popular sports in the  country include&nbsp;martial arts, basketball, football, table tennis,  badminton, swimming and&nbsp;snooker.&nbsp;Board games&nbsp;such  as&nbsp;go&nbsp;(known asweiqi&nbsp;in China),&nbsp;xiangqi, and more  recently&nbsp;chess, are also played at a professional level.[407]<br />
    Physical  fitness&nbsp;is widely emphasized in Chinese culture, with morning exercises such  asqigong&nbsp;and&nbsp;t'ai chi ch'uan&nbsp;widely practiced,[408]&nbsp;and  commercial&nbsp;gyms&nbsp;and fitness clubs gaining popularity in the  country.[409]&nbsp;Young people in China are also enjoy soccer and basketball,  especially in urban centers with limited space and grass areas. The  AmericanNational Basketball Association&nbsp;has a huge following among the  Chinese youth, with ethnic or native Chinese players such as&nbsp;Yao  Ming&nbsp;and&nbsp;Jeremy Lin&nbsp;held in high esteem.[410]&nbsp;In addition,  China is home to a huge number of&nbsp;cyclists, with an estimated 470 million  bicycles as of 2012.[321]&nbsp;Many more traditional sports, such  as&nbsp;dragon boat&nbsp;racing,&nbsp;Mongolian-style  wrestling&nbsp;and&nbsp;horse racing&nbsp;are also popular.[411]<br />
    China  has&nbsp;participated in the Olympic Games&nbsp;since 1932, although it has  only participated as the PRC&nbsp;since 1952. China hosted the2008 Summer  Olympics&nbsp;in Beijing, where its athletes received 51 gold medals &ndash;&nbsp;the  highest number of gold medals&nbsp;of any participating nation that  year.[412]&nbsp;China also won the most medals of any nation at the&nbsp;2012  Summer Paralympics, with 231 overall, including 95 gold  medals.[413][414]&nbsp;China hosted the&nbsp;2013 East Asian Games&nbsp;in  Tianjin and will host the&nbsp;2014 Summer Youth Olympics&nbsp;in&nbsp;Nanjing.</p>
