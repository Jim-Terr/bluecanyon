          <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Is 
            the film industry really as good as it seems in New Mexico? With announcements 
            of <a href="http://www.abqjournal.com/news/metro/516069metro11-28-06.htm">Steven 
            Seagal</a> movies being shot downtown (today's Albuquerque Journal), 
            and the Department of Labor saying the information sector's improvement 
            in job growth is partly due to the film industry, nary a negative 
            word can be spoken. And hey, it's pretty fun. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Local 
            filmmaker Jim Terr has been a tenacious, if sometimes strange, force 
            in the locally-grown entertainment media market. Now Jim reports that 
            one of his short films - the one he says is his best - will be produced 
            as a two-hour radio drama for local and national broadcast on KUNM, 
            Albuquerque's NPR affiliate, in the summer of 2007. Casting sessions 
            were held last week, bringing in over 100 actors to auditions in Santa 
            Fe and Albuquerque.<i> "The Home of Katie Archer" </i>has a familiar 
            ring; it started life as a story about an actor struggling to make 
            it as a full-time carpenter and part-time actor in a small New Mexico 
            town visited often by Hollywood movies and settled by Hollywood actors.

          <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It 
            has since morphed into a larger tale with a historical back story. 
            Terr writes on his <a href="http://www.bluecanyonproductions.com/trailertrance/newspage.htm">website</a> 
            that he's already spoken to several "well-known celebrities" about 
            cameo voices in his radio play. He's also hoping to produce the script 
            as a full-length feature film. <br>
