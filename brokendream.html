    <br />
A woman I knew in the days of my youth<br />
Used the bone of a cat, a bat&rsquo;s wing, a hound&rsquo;s tooth<br />
To divine and entwine all the realms there before, <br />
To make her aware of what might lie in store. <br />
<br />
But one thing reserved mostly for her own use,<br />
Which contained, as it were, the most powerful juice,<br />
The most mojo and juju to make a life better <br />
Was the spooky but beautiful Broken Dream Catcher. <br />
<br />
One hung in the closet, one in the back hall, <br />
Another where you hardly saw it at all. <br />
She explained to me once how a totem so eerie<br />
Could help make your life just a little more cheery. <br />
<br />
We all have our doubts and our fears, she explained, <br />
Our terrors and memories laden with pain,<br />
Our wishes unfilled, our nightmares extreme, <br />
All taken together, our much broken dreams. <br />
<br />
Unlike good-luck charms and crocheted words of cheer<br />
I suggest, placed maybe up there or here,<br />
A Broken Dream Catcher to capture the gloom,<br />
To keep it confined in one part of a room. <br />
<br />
Thus leaving some space for your cheerier mind, <br />
For thoughts and events of merrier kind.<br />
A kingdom expander, a boundary stretcher, <br />
The quiet but powerful Broken Dream Catcher.<br />
<br />
So unto today I employ it routinely<br />
To draw off the bad thoughts and sadness quite cleanly. <br />
I know not what they might attract or repel<br />
But I must say my life has been going quite well. <br />
<br />
So if a small figure in black veil you see <br />
When you visit a friend&rsquo;s house for coffee or tea<br />
Do not be afraid, it might be for the better<br />
That not too far away is a Broken Dream Catcher.</p>
