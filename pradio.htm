      TO PROMOTE PUBLIC &amp; COMMUNITY RADIO!</em></strong></span></p>
      <p class="style10">I love public and community radio -- absolutely couldn't live without
        them -- and therefore am very frustrated with what I see as tremendous <strong>missed
        opportunities </strong> to make them available to the wider audience
        which (trust me!) is <strong>not </strong> aware of them: </p>
      <p align="left" class="style10">1. LOCAL COMMUNITY RADIO STATIONS: I see many beautiful
        ads which capture the essence of community radio – but only IF you're
        already aware of it, and therefore are a great waste of time. That great
        majority who AREN'T aware could be made aware of your station by one
        simple technique: </p>
      <p align="left" class="style10">Look for <strong>specific </strong> upcoming programs or
        specials which will grab the attention of the general community, or large
        segments, for whatever reason. Advertise THAT, <em> not the station in
        general. </em></p>
      <p class="style10">Bringing people to a <strong>particular </strong> program, even once,
        will make them aware of the station and where it is on the dial! </p>
      <p class="style10">Your local papers should be glad to promote your upcoming programs in
        news stories and in their calendar. After all, unlike commercial radio
        and TV, you are NOT competing with the newspaper for advertising dollars! </p>
      <p align="left" class="style10">2. NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO: NPR has a wonderfully full and
        active website and archives. I often hear a great news feature and then
        send out e-mails to friends suggesting they go hear it on the archives.
        WHAT IF NPR offered an e-mail sign-up specifically for listeners to be
        informed in advance of upcoming features on the next couple <em>days' “Morning
        Edition”, “All Things Considered” </em>, etc? </p>
      <p class="style10">We could then inform <strong>more friends </strong> – <em>including
          those who aren't aware of public and community radio </em>(and most
          people ARE NOT) – in advance -- about upcoming items of interest. As
          above, getting people to tune in to public radio (and your station)
          once, will make them aware of it from then on!! (If ABC's <em>Nightline </em> can
          do this, why not NPR??) </p>
