            have a challenge for Governor Richardson, not because of anything 
            he's done wrong but because he's done so much right here, including 
            creating a near-miracle by bringing so much film production to the 
            state.<br>
            <br>
            We all know that illegal immigration, primarily from Mexico, creates 
            some problems here (as well as benefits for many employers -- but 
            that's another story). Worse, it indicates a country to the south 
            whose economy is not working for many or most, driving its poorest 
            and most ambitious citizens to leave.<br>
            <br>
            With his smarts, his determination, his creativity and his bi-cultural 
            makeup, Governor Richardson is uniquely suited to work with Mexico 
            to help get their house in order. And selling them on the idea of 
            letting him do so will require all of his highly touted diplomatic 
            skills. <br>
            <br>
            Accomplishing something on this front would be a blessing for everyone, 
            and would give Richardson a dramatic legacy no matter what his future 
            plans. And it might even provide a model for economic improvement 
            in other countries where even more misery and cruelty is driven by 
            poverty.<br>
