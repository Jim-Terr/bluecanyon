		<strong>Trump promised to get revenge. Here are his targets.</strong></span><br class="auto-style9" />
		<span class="auto-style9">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From Politico: <br />
		<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/06/trump-retribution-enemy-list-00187725" target="_blank">
		https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/06/trump-retribution-enemy-list-00187725</a></span><br class="auto-style9" />
		<span class="auto-style9">From Liz Cheney to Jack Smith to Mark Milley, 
		Trump has a lengthy inventory of people he’s pledged to punish.</span><br class="auto-style9" />
		<br class="auto-style9" />
		<span class="auto-style9">Donald Trump ran a campaign based on 
		retribution. Now he is perfectly positioned to carry it out.</span><br class="auto-style9" />
		<span class="auto-style9">For years, Trump has peppered his speeches and 
		social media posts with vengeful calls for his political opponents, his 
		critics and members of the media to be prosecuted, locked up, deported 
		and even executed. In the waning weeks of the 2024 campaign, he 
		escalated those promises of retaliation to a fever pitch.</span><br class="auto-style9" />
		<span class="auto-style9">But others — including some of Trump’s closest 
		advisers — have warned ominously that he’s far more likely to follow 
		through in a second term. He won’t be inhibited by the need to run for 
		reelection. He will be emboldened by a Supreme Court ruling that grants 
		presidents broad immunity from criminal accountability after they leave 
		office. And he is expected to be surrounded by aides more willing to 
		dispense with norms to carry out his wishes.</span><br class="auto-style9" />
		<span class="auto-style9">Based on Trump’s own words, here are the 
		people who have the most to fear.</span><br class="auto-style9" />
		<span class="auto-style9"><strong>President Joe Biden</strong></span><br class="auto-style9" />
		<span class="auto-style9">Trump has frequently called Biden corrupt and, 
		in June, reposted a Truth Social message that said he should be 
		“arrested for treason.” In a speech last year, Trump vowed: “I will 
		appoint a real special prosecutor to go after the most corrupt president 
		in the history of the United States of America, Joe Biden, and the 
		entire Biden crime family.”</span><br class="auto-style9" />
		<span class="auto-style9"><strong>Vice President Kamala Harris</strong></span><br class="auto-style9" />
		<span class="auto-style9">Trump has described Harris’ failure to control 
		migration as so severe that people have been “murdered because of her 
		action at the border.” He told a campaign rally in Pennsylvania in 
		September that Harris “should be impeached and prosecuted” for her role 
		in permitting what he termed an “invasion” of the U.S. by undocumented 
		immigrants.</span><br class="auto-style9" />
		<span class="auto-style9"><strong>Former President Barack Obama</strong></span><br class="auto-style9" />
		<span class="auto-style9">In 2020, Trump accused Obama of “treason” for 
		what Trump describes as the FBI’s surveillance of his 2016 presidential 
		campaign over its ties to Russia. In fact, the email snooping was aimed 
		at a former foreign policy adviser to that campaign.</span><br class="auto-style9" />
		<span class="auto-style9">In August of this year, Trump reposted a 
		message on Truth Social calling for “public military tribunals” for 
		Obama.</span><br class="auto-style9" />
		<span class="auto-style9"><strong>Former Secretary of State Hillary 
		Clinton</strong></span><br class="auto-style9" />
		<span class="auto-style9">“Lock her up!” was a memorable refrain of 
		Trump’s 2016 campaign rallies, alluding vaguely to Clinton’s use of a 
		private email account while secretary of state and the ensuing FBI 
		investigation, which did not lead to any charges.</span><br class="auto-style9" />
		<span class="auto-style9">In an interview in June of this year, Trump 
		suggested Clinton should face the same sort of criminal prosecutions 
		brought against him. “Wouldn’t it be terrible to throw the president’s 
		wife and the former secretary of state … into jail?” Trump told Newsmax. 
		“It’s a terrible, terrible, path that they’re leading us to and it’s 
		very possible that it’s going to have to happen to them.”</span><br class="auto-style9" />
		<span class="auto-style9"><strong>Former Speaker Nancy Pelosi</strong></span><br class="auto-style9" />
		<span class="auto-style9">In September, Trump said Pelosi should face 
		criminal charges in connection with her husband’s sale of Visa stock a 
		few months before the Justice Department sued the company for alleged 
		antitrust violations. “Nancy Pelosi should be prosecuted for that,” 
		Trump said.</span><br class="auto-style9" />
		<span class="auto-style9">He also said Pelosi should be prosecuted for 
		failing to ensure adequate security at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, when 
		Trump supporters stormed the building as Congress was preparing to 
		certify Biden’s win in the 2020 presidential race.</span><br class="auto-style9" />
		<span class="auto-style9">In a speech Monday, Trump said Pelosi 
		“could’ve gone to jail for” theatrically ripping up a copy of Trump’s 
		State of the Union address while sitting behind him on the House rostrum 
		in 2020.</span><br class="auto-style9" />
		<span class="auto-style9"><strong>New York Attorney General Letitia 
		James</strong></span><br class="auto-style9" />
		<span class="auto-style9">James earned Trump’s ire as a result of the 
		lawsuit she brought alleging widespread fraud in Trump’s business 
		empire. The case resulted in a judgment of more than $450 million 
		against Trump, who has appealed.</span><br class="auto-style9" />
		<span class="auto-style9">Last November, Trump said on Truth Social that 
		James “should be prosecuted” for her role in the suit. In January, he 
		said at a campaign rally in Iowa that James “should be arrested and 
		punished accordingly.”</span><br class="auto-style9" />
		<span class="auto-style9">Trump has also reportedly expressed enthusiasm 
		about plans some of his legal supporters have discussed to prosecute 
		James for election interference.</span><br class="auto-style9" />
		<span class="auto-style9"><strong>Manhattan Justice Arthur Engoron</strong></span><br class="auto-style9" />
		<span class="auto-style9">Engoron, a New York trial judge, faced a 
		torrent of attacks from Trump while presiding over James’ civil fraud 
		case. At a campaign event early this year, Trump said Engoron “should be 
		arrested and punished accordingly.”</span><br class="auto-style9" />
		<span class="auto-style9">Cheney (R-Wyo.) angered Trump while serving as 
		vice chair of the House select committee that investigated the Jan. 6, 
		2021, attack on the Capitol. She is also one of the most prominent 
		Republican figures to publicly endorse Harris over Trump. In March, 
		Trump declared on Truth Social that Cheney “should go to jail.” In June, 
		he reposted a message calling Cheney “guilty of treason.” And in the 
		final days of the 2024 campaign, Trump mused: “Let’s put her with a 
		rifle standing there with nine barrels shooting at her.” He said he was 
		accusing her of hypocrisy for supporting the war in Iraq.</span><br class="auto-style9" />
		<span class="auto-style9"><strong>Special counsel Jack Smith</strong></span><br class="auto-style9" />
		<span class="auto-style9">Smith, who brought both of the federal 
		criminal cases against Trump, is a frequent punching bag for the former 
		president. Last year, Trump reposted a social media message from 
		conservative talk show host Mark Levin saying Smith “must go to prison.” 
		In August, Trump reposted a message calling “Jackal Smith … a career 
		criminal” and saying he “should be prosecuted for election interference 
		and prosecutorial misconduct.” Last month, appearing on a radio show, 
		Trump called Smith “mentally deranged” and said he “should be thrown out 
		of the country.”</span><br class="auto-style9" />
		<span class="auto-style9"><strong>Manhattan District Attorney Alvin 
		Bragg</strong></span><br class="auto-style9" />
		<span class="auto-style9">Another one of Trump’s courtroom adversaries 
		is Bragg, who brought the case that led to the former president’s 
		conviction on 34 felony charges stemming from a scheme to secretly pay 
		$130,000 to porn star Stormy Daniels to keep her quiet during the 2016 
		election about her claims of a sexual encounter with Trump.</span><br class="auto-style9" />
		<span class="auto-style9">“There is a case to be made … that the 
		prosecutor should be prosecuted — the district attorney should be 
		prosecuted,” Trump told reporters during the trial in May.</span><br class="auto-style9" />
		<span class="auto-style9"><strong>Former Chair of the Joint Chiefs of 
		Staff Mark Milley</strong></span><br class="auto-style9" />
		<span class="auto-style9">For more than three years, Trump has railed 
		against Milley, claiming that the general’s contact with a Chinese 
		official during the tense transition period four years ago amounted to 
		treason. “This is an act so egregious that, in times gone by, the 
		punishment would have been DEATH!” Trump declared in a social media post 
		last year. The feud was reignited in recent days after Milley called 
		Trump “fascist to his core.”</span><br class="auto-style9" />
		<span class="auto-style9"><strong>Former FBI Director James Comey</strong></span><br class="auto-style9" />
		<span class="auto-style9">Trump famously fired Comey in 2017 and pushed 
		unsuccessfully behind the scenes for Comey to be prosecuted over his 
		interactions with journalists. When Comey released a book the following 
		year, Trump lashed out on Twitter, claiming the former FBI chief “leaked 
		CLASSIFIED information, for which he should be prosecuted,” and lied to 
		Congress. The Justice Department declined to bring any charges against 
		Comey after an inspector general investigation cleared him of leaking 
		classified information, but faulted him for violating DOJ policies on 
		handling of sensitive information.</span><br class="auto-style9" />
		<span class="auto-style9"><strong>Hunter Biden and the rest of the Biden 
		family</strong></span><br class="auto-style9" />
		<span class="auto-style9">Trump has said he’ll name a special counsel to 
		investigate what he says is corruption involving Biden’s family. He’s 
		been vague about who would be investigated and for what, but has 
		sometimes spoken of money Biden’s son Hunter accepted from Chinese 
		sources. “When I get back in office, I will appoint a real special 
		prosecutor to investigate every detail of the Biden crime family of 
		corruption,” Trump said last year.</span><br class="auto-style9" />
		<span class="auto-style9">Hunter Biden was found guilty on gun-related 
		charges in June and pleaded guilty to tax violations in September. He’s 
		never faced any charge directly related to his work for foreign 
		entities.</span><br class="auto-style9" />
		<span class="auto-style9"><strong>Former FBI special agent Peter Strzok</strong></span><br class="auto-style9" />
		<span class="auto-style9">For more than six years, Trump has been 
		accusing Strzok of treason based on text messages he exchanged while 
		working on aspects of the investigation into possible Russian influence 
		on Trump’s 2016 campaign. Some messages released by DOJ’s officials in 
		2017 showed Strzok disparaging Trump as an “idiot” and saying in 
		reference to Trump potentially becoming president: “I’m afraid we can’t 
		take that risk.” Strzok has disputed Trump’s interpretation of the 
		messages and said he was not suggesting the FBI would prevent Trump from 
		serving as president.</span><br class="auto-style9" />
		<span class="auto-style9"><strong>Former FBI attorney Lisa Page</strong></span><br class="auto-style9" />
		<span class="auto-style9">Trump has also lambasted Page, who was in a 
		romantic relationship with Strzok, suggesting she is guilty of treason 
		based on her comments in the text exchanges.</span><br class="auto-style9" />
		<span class="auto-style9"><strong>Rep. Adam Schiff</strong></span><br class="auto-style9" />
		<span class="auto-style9">Trump has repeatedly excoriated Schiff 
		(D-Calif.), who was elected to the Senate on Tuesday and served as chair 
		of the House Intelligence Committee when Trump was in office and under 
		intense scrutiny over his ties to Russia. In 2019, Trump clashed with 
		Schiff after Schiff read what he acknowledged was an exaggerated version 
		of what Trump might have said in a controversial phone call with 
		Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. “It bore NO relationship to 
		what I said on the call. Arrest for Treason?” Trump wrote on Twitter.</span><br class="auto-style9" />
		<span class="auto-style9">Trump’s vitriol against Schiff has continued, 
		with the former president posting on Truth Social last year: “Schiff is 
		a sleazebag and traitor, and should be prosecuted for the damage he has 
		done to our Country!”</span><br class="auto-style9" />
		<span class="auto-style9"><strong>Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg</strong></span><br class="auto-style9" />
		<span class="auto-style9">Trump and some of his allies have been sharply 
		critical of Zuckerberg after he and his wife, Priscilla Chan, gave $420 
		million in 2020 to improve election infrastructure. Trump backers 
		contend the money was a thinly veiled plot to undercut his reelection. 
		In a book released in September, Trump accused Zuckerberg of a “shameful 
		… plot against the president” and warned: “We are watching him closely, 
		and if he does anything illegal this time he will spend the rest of his 
		life in prison.”</span><br class="auto-style9" />
		<span class="auto-style9"><strong>Former Manhattan Assistant District 
		Attorney Mark Pomerantz</strong></span><br class="auto-style9" />
		<span class="auto-style9">Trump attacked former prosecutor Pomerantz, 
		who quit Bragg’s office after Bragg initially refused to file charges 
		against the former president. In a Truth Social post last year, Trump 
		said Pomerantz engaged in “disgraceful conduct” by writing a book about 
		his work and said the prosecutor could face a felony charge for 
		disclosing secret grand jury information. Pomerantz said in his book 
		that he was careful not to reveal grand jury information. No charge was 
		ever filed.</span><br class="auto-style9" />
		<span class="auto-style9"><strong>Former Trump attorney Michael Cohen</strong></span><br class="auto-style9" />
		<span class="auto-style9">Trump has repeatedly lashed out at Cohen, his 
		former lawyer and fixer who turned on him about a year and a half into 
		his presidency and became a key witness at the hush money trial. “Cohen 
		should be prosecuted for lying and all of the tumult and cost he put the 
		D.A.’s Office through,” Trump wrote on Truth Social last year.</span><br class="auto-style9" />
		<span class="auto-style9">After Cohen testified in the civil fraud case 
		against Trump and his companies last year, Trump reposted a message 
		quoting his lawyer Alina Habba as saying Cohen perjured himself: “Cohen 
		should be prosecuted for what he did in that courtroom.”</span><br class="auto-style9" />
		<span class="auto-style9"><strong>U.S. Capitol Police Lt. Michael Byrd</strong></span><br class="auto-style9" />
		<span class="auto-style9">Trump has joined with his supporters — some of 
		whom took part in the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot — to call for 
		prosecution of Byrd, the U.S. Capitol Police officer who shot and killed 
		rioter Ashli Babbitt as she attempted to breach the entrance to the 
		Speaker’s Lobby while House members were being evacuated. The Justice 
		Department announced in April 2021 that it closed the investigation into 
		Babbitt’s death and no charges would be filed against Byrd. Last year, 
		Trump called Byrd a “thug” and “coward,” adding: “Ashli Babbitt was 
		murdered!”</span><br class="auto-style9" />
		<span class="auto-style9"><strong>Rep. Jamaal Bowman</strong></span><br class="auto-style9" />
		<span class="auto-style9">After Bowman (D-N.Y.) pulled a fire alarm in a 
		House office building last year as his party sought to delay a vote on a 
		spending bill, Trump called for the lawmaker to face an obstruction of 
		Congress charge. “It was a very dangerous ‘Obstruction of an Official 
		Proceeding,’ the same as used against our J-6 prisoners,” Trump wrote on 
		Truth Social. “Actually, his act may have been worse. HE MUST SUFFER 
		THEIR SAME FATE. WHEN WILL HIS TRIAL BEGIN???”</span><br class="auto-style9" />
		<span class="auto-style9">51 intelligence professionals who signed 
		letter about Hunter Biden laptop</span><br class="auto-style9" />
		<span class="auto-style9">Trump remains galled by a letter from 
		intelligence professionals weeks before the 2020 presidential election, 
		contending that a release of purported emails from Hunter Biden “has all 
		the classic earmarks of a Russian information operation.” The 
		ex-officials acknowledged in the letter that they didn’t know for 
		certain whether the emails were “genuine,” but said the disclosures were 
		“suspicious.”</span><br class="auto-style9" />
		<span class="auto-style9">Subsequent reporting and evidence prosecutors 
		presented at Hunter Biden’s trial in Delaware earlier this year support 
		the authenticity of the messages. Prosecutors extracted many of Biden’s 
		messages from a laptop he left for repair at a computer shop near his 
		home.</span><br class="auto-style9" />
		<span class="auto-style9">In 2022, Trump reposted on Truth Social a New 
		York Post cover dubbing the signatories “Spies who lie,” and another 
		message that asked: “When are the intelligence Officers That signed the 
		‘Hunter Biden laptop is Russian disinformation’ letter going to JAIL?”</span><br class="auto-style9" />
		<span class="auto-style9">“They should be prosecuted for what they did,” 
		Trump added at a June rally.</span><br class="auto-style9" />
		<span class="auto-style9"><strong>Members of the Jan. 6 select committee</strong></span><br class="auto-style9" />
		<span class="auto-style9">While singling out Cheney for particular 
		scorn, Trump has also blasted the other eight members of the Jan. 6 
		committee and repeatedly urged that they face criminal charges. “The 
		Unselect Committee of political Hacks &amp; Thugs has been totally 
		discredited,” Trump wrote on Truth Social last year. “They should be 
		tried for Fraud and Treason, and those imprisoned and being persecuted 
		should be exonerated and released, NOW!”</span><br class="auto-style9" />
		<span class="auto-style9"><strong>Unspecified people engaged in election 
		fraud</strong></span><br class="auto-style9" />
		<span class="auto-style9">Despite few examples of verified election 
		fraud, Trump has threatened severe criminal consequences for anyone who 
		engages in such behavior, and he’s muddied the waters by suggesting such 
		tampering went on during the 2020 race — and was bound to occur in 2024, 
		too.</span><br class="auto-style9" />
		<span class="auto-style9">“WHEN I WIN, those people that CHEATED will be 
		prosecuted to the fullest extent of the Law, which will include long 
		term prison sentences so that this Depravity of Justice does not happen 
		again,” Trump said on Truth Social in September. “Please beware that 
		this legal exposure extends to Lawyers, Political Operatives, Donors, 
		Illegal Voters, &amp; Corrupt Election Officials. Those involved in 
		unscrupulous behavior will be sought out, caught, and prosecuted at 
		levels, unfortunately, never seen before in our Country.”</span><br class="auto-style9" />
		<span class="auto-style9"><strong>POLITICO reporters, editors and 
		publisher</strong></span><br class="auto-style9" />
		<span class="auto-style9">Trump has also called for stern measures — 
		including imprisonment — for journalists who refuse to identify their 
		sources. He specifically seized on POLITICO’s exclusive report in May 
		2022 about a draft Supreme Court opinion overturning Roe v. Wade. The 
		Supreme Court announced in January 2023 that an investigation it 
		conducted had failed to conclusively identify any individuals who 
		disclosed the draft, but Trump has told his supporters that more 
		aggressive tactics could quickly ascertain the source.</span><br class="auto-style9" />
		<span class="auto-style9">“Go to the reporter &amp; ask him/her who it was. 
		If not given the answer, put whoever in jail until the answer is given. 
		You might add the publisher and editor to the list,” Trump wrote on 
		Truth Social last year. “Stop playing games, this leaking cannot be 
		allowed to happen. It won’t take long before the name of this slime is 
		revealed!”</span><br class="auto-style9" />
		<span class="auto-style9">At a rally in 2022, Trump raised the specter 
		of prison rape as a potential tool to identify a leaker.</span><br class="auto-style9" />
		<span class="auto-style9">“When the reporter learns that he’s going to 
		be married in two days to a certain prisoner that’s extremely strong, 
		tough and mean, he will say … ‘You know, I think I’m going to give you 
		the information. Here’s the leaker. Get me the hell out of here.’”</span><br />
