  <P>Nationally broadcast song satirist Jim Terr has released his first CD, a 
    72-minute, 23-song collection featuring himself and numerous guest artists.</P>
  <P>Terr, whose song satires and commentaries have aired on radio networks and 
    programs from NPR to ABC, Voice of America to the BBC, and Larry King to &quot;Mountain 
    Stage&quot; and &quot;Doctor Demento,&quot; debuted the new release in conjunction 
    with a one-man show he presented in November in Santa Fe, NM.</P>
  <P>The songs were selected from among hundreds of song demos and master recordings 
    of his compositions in order to create the CD, entitled &quot;Demos and Diamonds.&quot;&#9;</P>
  <P>Writers from Dave Barry to Tony Hillerman have praised Terr’s work [see CD], 
    and former BMI vice president Rick Sanjek has described Terr as &quot;a modern-day 
    Mark Twain, Will Rogers, Jimmie Rodgers and Jackie Mason rolled into one.&quot; 
    Terr’s songs, including an original which he performed in the 1988 film, &quot;And 
    God Created Woman,&quot; starring Rebecca DeMornay, have been broadcast in 
    over 20 foreign countries, according to BMI records.</P>
  <P>In addition to his singing/songwriting, Terr is the author of &quot;The New 
    Mexico Driver’s Survival Guide,&quot; and the producer of a nationally-acclaimed 
    video of interviews with New Mexico World War II veterans and a forthcoming 
    videotape of interviews with New Mexico survivors of the Holocaust. He is 
    also an actor who has appeared in several commercials, independent features 
    and short films.</P>
  <P>The new CD (Blue Canyon Productions # BCCD 880) is initially being offered 
    for retail sale only in New Mexico, where it has received considerable radio 
    airplay, and is available on-line at the new website, www.bluecanyonproductions.com, 
    or by calling toll-free 1-877-723-4611 during daytime business hours.</P>
  <P>Terr describes the assortment of songs on the CD as ranging &quot;from the 
    ridiculous to the sublime.&quot; The songs, recorded from 1973 through 1999, 
    feature guest artists from New Mexico, California, Hawaii and Nashville, including 
    Francine Hand, &quot;Bluegrass Vocalist of the Year&quot; Kathy Chiavola, 
    Elvis impersonator Lonnie Yanes, Nancy Gagan, the late actor Slim Pickens, 
    Buddy Converse and the Sneakers, &quot;Sara Jo Rubenstein,&quot; &quot;Edie,&quot; 
    and 14-year-old &quot;Lilia,&quot; as well as Terr, who lives in Santa Fe. 
  </P>

  <P><FONT FACE="Calisto MT">Several of the CD’s selections are from previous 
    album releases, including a song called &quot;Son of a Rabbi Man,&quot; from 
    a 1994 Jewish parody of Woodstock called &quot;CHICKENSTOCK: A Festival of 
    Peace, Love and Matzo Balls,&quot; and a selection from another critically-acclaimed 
    album, Slim Pickens’ 1975 self-titled release. </font><I><FONT FACE="Calisto MT" SIZE=1>12-3-99</font></i></P>

    <B>Jim Terr "Demos and Diamonds"</B></FONT><BR>
  <P>&quot;I could make just about anything / with cardboard, scissors, glue and 
    string / wire, Scotch Tape, rubber bands / a paper clip, a coffee can,&quot; 
    sings Jim Terr in &quot;Reader's Digest Me&quot;, a song off his &quot;Demos 
    and Diamonds&quot; CD. Out of the musical equivalents of those bits and pieces, 
    he's crafted some of the most thoroughly enjoyable tunes I've ever heard. 
    Terr's songs--performed here by Terr, Slim Pickens, local music progenitor 
    Nancy Gagan and a handful of Terr's friends--are tiny monuments to songwriting.</P>
  <P>It's hard to listen to this CD without drifting into nostalgic recollections 
    of times with friends when you couldn't stop laughing, times with lovers when 
    you couldn't stop crying and every day that you couldn't stop loving just 
    being alive. If you haven't finished your holiday shopping, go pick up a few 
    copies for the people you care about. And if you are finished, well, go buy 
    it for them anyway.</P>
  <P>For whatever elements came together to make the genius of Jim Terr and his 
    music happen, we should be truly gleeful, grateful and gratified. "Demos and 
    Diamonds" is a square meal of music, a walk around town when all the lights 
    are out and your first kiss, all over again. </P>

  <P><FONT SIZE="+2"><B>Terr's CD spans parody, eye-opening sincerity</B></FONT><BR>
    By Steve Terrell, Santa Fe New Mexican "Pasatiempo" Dec. 3, 1999</P>
  <P>Jim Terr has been part of the local music scene for about 25 years now as 
    producer, songwriter and performer. It seems strange that this is his first 
    CD.</P>
  <P>"Demos and Diamonds" is something of a “greatest hits’’ collection going 
    all the way back to 1973 with a country song called "Darlin’ You Can Come 
    and Stay With Me."</P>
  <P>Also from that era is raspy-voiced cowboy actor Slim Pickens singing a Terr 
    song, "A Stranger in Nashville." Terr produced an entire album by Pickens, 
    including the Guy Clark song "Desperadoes Waiting For A Train," which Clark 
    says is his favorite cover version of any of his tunes.</P>
  <P>Though Terr is well-known for his song parodies, most the songs here aren’t 
    overtly funny. But there are some exceptions - notably "Son of a Rabbi Man" 
    and the wicked "Ginkgo and Tofu," which is about a New Ager’s dog and a cat 
    forced by fate to suddenly shed their vegetarian lifestyle. It’s something 
    of a Cerrillos/Madrid version of Nick Lowe’s "Mary Provost."</P>
  <P>A few of the early-mid 80s cuts are too slick and pallid - as if perhaps 
    Terr was making a serious bid for Nashville recognition back during the Urban 
    Cowboy period. Fortunately, by 1986’s "She Taught Me How To Sing These Songs," 
    he’s at least got a rockin’ band. And "Do You Like To Jitterbug?," recorded 
    the year before, sounds as if he foresaw the rise of neo-swing nearly 15 years 
    early. </P>
  <P>My favorite tune here though is a recent one - "Reader’s Digest Me" - in 
    which Terr pleads guilty to being disgustingly normal and healthy. There’s 
    not a speck of cynicism in this song, no hipster sneer or Yuppie smirk. That 
    stuff ‘s far too predictable these days. But Terr’s simple sincerity found 
    in this song and the one about his father’s death (<a name="lyrics"></a>"The 
    Call," 1986) is eye-opening. </P>

  <P>Gringo in a Strange Land <BR>
    A One-Man Show by Jim Terr</P>

  <h2>ONE-MAN LAND</h2>

  <p></P>
  <p><i>Get to know Jim Terr. It's fun, it's good for you, and it only takes three 
    hours. [actually, it's closer to 2 hours]</i></P>
  <BR>
  By Bill Hutchison and Sarah Meadows
  <p></P>
  <P>Would it be fair for one person to review a one-man show? There's something 
    about that prospect that seems . . . well, one-on-one. Not enough perspectives 
    would be involved; the whole thing might become one ego against another. Is 
    it any fairer for two people to review a one-man show? Well, we combined two 
    egos to find out.</P>
  <P>S.M: Sometimes, watching one person perform autobiographical material can 
    feel uncomfortable. It's possible to feel assaulted by feelings too intimate 
    to be revealed; you're thinking, I don't even know this person, why are they 
    telling me such detailed things about their personal life and history? But 
    Jim Terr manages to avoid any sentimental pleading with his audience to forgive 
    him for his sins, to appreciate his struggles or to laugh along with his funnier 
    memories. Indeed, it is by virtue of this achievement that we are able to 
    do just that.</P>
  <P>B.H: There is a certain forgiveness, I think, that is implicitly and instinctively 
    asked for in being so unapologetically human in front of an audience. The 
    idea of showing a group of people this glimpse, deep and occasionally embarrassing, 
    into a part of one man's mind is, at the same time, to show the secret parts 
    that most of us keep hidden. Jim Terr does it without being too self-conscious 
    of it; his hometown persona is a perfect blend of Eddie Haskell and Beaver 
    Cleaver as it sings to you slightly out of tune and gut-bustingly funny, or 
    tells you a tale that might have come out of your living room when you were 
    a kid, with mom yelling or after dad had a little too much to drink; the things 
    the neighbors never saw.</P>
  <P>S.M: That element of the show was the most powerful, and the fact that Terr's 
    mom was sitting in the audience made it more so. Before he started, Terr noted 
    that his stories and songs weren't necessarily related, and that some of it 
    might seem rather non-sequitur. This made it all even more profound: the fact 
    that he wasn’t trying to force some faked relevance into the show. It was 
    all very, very real. Whether or not the individual stories were enthralling 
    (many were, some weren't so much) was of no importance. What mattered was 
    the intimacy and honesty; I feel like I know Jim Terr. But not in a creepy 
    way. I don't feel invaded by his personal history.</P>
  <P>B.H: The programs handed out looked like the programs handed out for the 
    plays we performed in Mrs. Geuder's second grade class. The authenticity of 
    combining cut-n-paste graphics with the Kinko's photocopier gives me a warm 
    affection for the kid who grew up to be such a strangely sensitive and bizarrely 
    funny man. The letter from Terr's dad included in the program knocked me out: 
    here's his physician father expressing an obvious love for his son in lines 
    like, &quot;Dear Jim . . . If you are choosing this diet by preference, I 
    think you have peculiar taste . . . Please take this advice as concern, not 
    denigration." And the invitation he extended to his mom-- during the show!-- 
    to check his facts as he went along underscored his intense love for his family. 
    There I was, listening to it all and trying to figure out how to accept my 
    own anger at my family's dark, cobwebbed corners. Two minutes later, though, 
    I'm laughing my ass off as Terr sings about Ginkgo the Dog and Tofu the Cat, 
    who [I've taken the liberty of deleting the end of this sentence, in which 
    he gives away the hopefully-surprise ending of the song].</P>
  <P>S.M: At the risk of sounding like said hippie, I must say that Terr created 
    a room full of love. In the middle of the second act, I found myself uncontrollably 
    craving mushy, boiled cabbage and carrots with butter and salt, the way my 
    mom would serve it when she made pot roast. It took me a while to figure out 
    that this craving came from suddenly missing my mom, and that was inspired 
    by Terr's stories. I'd say the weaker points of his show came when he played 
    covers of other peoples' songs. It was nice to hear his influences, but the 
    fact is, the cover songs weren't as good as his songs.</P>
  <P>B.H: I'm pretty reluctant to say anything about the weak points. Some of 
    the weaknesses seemed to enrich the genuineness of Terr (who convincingly 
    played Jim Terr for just shy of three hours) [again, it's closer to 2 hours!]. 
    I wouldn't have been sold if the sound guy had remembered all his cues, or 
    if Terr's guitar was perfectly in tune, or if he remembered all the words 
    to his songs. If you want to see a refined monologuist or listen to a polished 
    musician, stay home and watch TV. If you're interested in seeing a man bare 
    his life and all its inherent flaws in a performance full of both life and 
    flaws, then Jim Terr's Gringo in a Strange Land is the perfect thing.</P>

        <p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Part   One</strong></p>
        <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p><strong>&nbsp; </strong>Jerry Heist, being a collector of records, puts great stock   into what some people</p>
        <p>might consider obscure   record labels. For instance, he traded me a bunch of   Mercury</p>
        <p>Big Bopper 45s for one copy   of "Chantilly Lace" I had on a less-well-known   label.</p>
        <p>Jerry regularly makes the   local junk stores hunting records and some months   ago</p>
        <p>came up with a real find.   It was (1) a local label&mdash;from Las   Vegas, New Mexico&mdash;and </p>
        <p>(2) a good contemporary   country recording. J. Ben-Isaac and the Waterbears on   Blue</p>
        <p>Canyon   Records.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; A few days later, Jerry   discovered J. Ben-Isaac had appeard at Rosa's   in Algodones </p>
        <p>and he found a poster for   that show&mdash;a very strange photograph of what might   have</p>
        <p>been the classic punk band   all crowded into a bus-station photo-booth.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; When Jim Terr of Blue   Canyon Records finally showed up at my door one   Sunday</p>
        <p>afternoon, I asked about J.   Ben-Isaac and discovered the connection between Jim   and</p>
        <p>J. Ben-Isaac was fairly   definite and ill-defined. More than talking about J.   Ben-Isaac,</p>
        <p>Jim was interested in   playing a tape of his new single. "Railroadin' Johnny" b/w   "The</p>
        <p>Roses I Remember" by Jay   Wise, late of San Antonio,   Texas.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; I asked Jim Terr how he   got on to Jay Wise and he explained that J. Ben-Isaac   had</p>
        <p>been casting about for a   guitar player, so Jim called his friend, Roger   Friedman&mdash;</p>
        <p>Kinky Friedman's   brother&mdash;and Friedman put him on to Jay Wise&mdash;who was an   old</p>
        <p>friend of the Friedmans and   a songwriter of some note. Kinky Friedman, in fact,</p>
        <p>co-produced the record with   Jim.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; Both sides of the single   deal to some extent with rodeo, which I found, is a kind   of</p>
        <p>obsession with Jay Wise.   Jay Wise has written a whole (un-recorded) rodeo   concept</p>
        <p>album for Tompall Glaser.   Jay told me he sees rodeo more as a symbol of life   in</p>
        <p>general than as a sporting   event.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; Jay Wise told me his   folks have been around San Antone since the 1830s; that   an</p>
        <p>ancestor of his was the   first Rabbi in Texas. He's been an anthropologist and   a</p>
        <p>somewhat revolutionary   urban social planner. He has a horse ranch at Dale   near</p>
        <p>Lockhart, Texas.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; The Blue Canyon record is getting a lot of radio   play. "Railroadin' Johnny," the</p>
        <p>plug side, isn't my   favorite kind of song. It's about an old man in San Antone   who's</p>
        <p>done some railroading and   rodeoing in his time; rambling songs aren't usually   my</p>
        <p>favorites. It has a steel   track of railroad sounds which is performed by Wayne</p>
        <p>Gaily, the steel player for   Albuquerque's   Swamproot band, and is very well</p>
        <p>done&mdash;but not too necessary.   The other side I like a lot better&mdash;I find it closer   to</p>
        <p>the clean, modern version   of traditional country production on the J.   Ben-Isaac</p>
        <p>record (which Jim Terr as   chief cook, etc. at Blue Canyon also   produced).</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; I've heard a demo tape of   several other Jay Wise songs which I think is very   good.</p>
        <p>It's literate (a   historically accurate song about several mountain men) and has   the</p>
        <p>proper attitude and   approach to country music. He writes songs which are aimed   at</p>
        <p>a country sound and country   audience, but they&mdash;like the best of the new country</p>
        <p>songs&mdash;don't try for any   obvious consciousness (which, when tried, usually   comes</p>
        <p>out more simplistic than   authentic). He writes narrative songs (which I like, as   a</p>
        <p>form) about cowboys and   mountain men and such&mdash;which are some of my favorite</p>
        <p>subjects.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; Jay Wise calls himself an   entertainer&mdash;as opposed, I expect, to a   performer&mdash;and</p>
        <p>that's accurate. His stage   act is professional and funny. Off stage, his conversion   is</p>
        <p>likely to be diagonal   rather than linear. When the microphone is turned on, he </p>
        <p>watches himself, and the   diagonalities take direction. Where the microphone   makes</p>
        <p>most people nervous, it   aids Jay; it justifies and gives purpose to his   performance&mdash;</p>
        <p>which goes on most all the   time anyway&mdash;off stage as well as on. I never saw him   as</p>
        <p>an anthropologist nor urban   planner&mdash;but as an entertainer, he's an entertainer   through</p>
        <p>and   through.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; Jay Wise shares the   Blue   Canyon catalogue with J.   Ben-Isaac and one other group. </p>
        <p>While that doesn't make for   something the size of Columbia Records, it's well</p>
        <p>balanced. Where J.   Ben-Isaac and the Waterbears are into an almost smooth   sound</p>
        <p>(J. Ben-Isaac can be   considered a smooth singer, I think), and Jay Wise is into   more</p>
        <p>artistic (and less smooth)   songs&mdash;but original&mdash;the third group does a lot of   other</p>
        <p>people's material and comes   on as a honky-tonk dance band. Which it is.</p>

        <p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;BLUE CANYON   RECORDS&rdquo;</strong></p>
        <p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Part   Two</strong></p>
        <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p><strong>&nbsp; </strong><em>The Last Mile   Ramblers</em>&mdash;whose first album <em>While   They Last </em>has just been </p>
        <p>released&mdash;formed several   years ago in Santa   Fe as a bluegrass band. Bluegrass</p>
        <p>seems to have an appeal to   young New   Mexico audiences&mdash;which are not in   any</p>
        <p>normal sense country   audiences. <em>The Last Mile Ramblers</em> have a very large</p>
        <p>following among those   folks, and as the band has moved beyond bluegrass to   other</p>
        <p>forms of country, a lot of   them have followed. In some kind of real sense, the   band</p>
        <p>has proved to be a country   music education for that group of people.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; Brandy at Rosa&rsquo;s says people will call up and ask if a bluegrass   band is playing;</p>
        <p>she&rsquo;ll say <em>The Last Mile Ramblers </em>are playing;   they&rsquo;ll say that&rsquo;s who they meant.</p>
        <p>Brandy will give them a   short lecture on the difference in bluegrass and   country.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; Of a Sunday afternoon at   the Golden Inn just south of Golden, New Mexico,</p>
        <p>where they do a regular gig   every Sunday afternoon, their fans are legion. On a</p>
        <p>typical muddy fall   afternoon enough mud is tracked onto the dance floor that   there</p>
        <p>hangs a pall of dust at   least to knee level and usually to ceiling level. The   Golden</p>
        <p>Inn is going under new   management and there&rsquo;s a promise for an exhaust fan.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a mixed crowd at   Golden&mdash;predominantly bearded and bluejeaned/booted   and</p>
        <p>long-dressed&mdash;but also a   smattering of what might be considered a   traditional</p>
        <p>country crowd. Some others   with leather clothes and a lot of expensive   turquoise</p>
        <p>and silver jewelry. More   than a few clean-cut-looking kids.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; With the exception of   Billy Joe Shaver&rsquo;s &ldquo;Black Rose&rdquo; and some Waylon   Jenning&rsquo;s</p>
        <p>material, I&rsquo;ve rarely heard   them perform anything newer than a dozen years old.</p>
        <p>They all express a good   deal of reverence for the masters (and past masters)   of</p>
        <p>country music. Their   knowledge is extensive, almost scholarly&mdash;they say   they</p>
        <p>greatly enjoy hearing an   old record, and then being able to re-create it. All of   them</p>
        <p>seem to like bluegrass   best, but their reverence includes all the music they   do.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; Every member of the band   sings. George &ldquo;Bullfrog&rdquo; Bourque plays flattop   guitar;</p>
        <p>Spook James plays bass.   J.B. Brown, lead and steel; Steve Keith, banjo and   fiddle.</p>
        <p>Charlie &ldquo;Relleno&rdquo; Jobes is   the drummer. Charlie once told me I should mention   the</p>
        <p>name of the <em>13th Floor Elevators</em> with   reverence.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; Which goes to show   Charlie knows his music&mdash;the <em>13th Floor   Elevators </em>was the</p>
        <p>Austin and Kerrville, Texas band which invented psychedelic music,   the term as</p>
        <p>well as the sound. Listen   to an old Elevators&rsquo; record and hear what <em>Big Brother </em>and</p>
        <p>the <em>Jefferson Airplane </em>did two or three years   later. Janis Joplin was set to sing with</p>
        <p>them when she got the offer   from Chet Helms to sing with <em>Big   Brother.</em></p>
        <p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp; Once at Rosa&rsquo;s, <em>The Last Mile   Ramblers </em>announced they were going to do an   Al</p>
        <p>Dean song&mdash;which surprised   me considerably. I have a talent for thinking nobody </p>
        <p>but me and a few other   people know anything&mdash;of course it could be that <em>The Last</em></p>
        <p><em>Mile   Ramblers</em> are a few of the few other people. Al Dean and the   All Stars is a</p>
        <p>South   Texas band of some longevity which is also well known   in Central and West</p>
        <p>Texas (and maybe East Texas, too, for all I know). They are perhaps the   best of the</p>
        <p>regional Texas country   bands.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; It was probably at that   exact moment&mdash;when they announced an Al Dean song&mdash;</p>
        <p>that I decided <em>The Last Mile Ramblers</em> were worth paying   attention to.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; Which of course means   they are a band worth listening to in the same sense <em>Asleep</em></p>
        <p><em>at the   Wheel </em>is worth it, or <em>Commander Cody. </em>They are as interesting   for their</p>
        <p>knowledge as for their   interpretation. But where <em>Asleep at the   Wheel</em> has staked out</p>
        <p>swing and <em>Commander Cody</em> has staked out fiftyish   rock and roll country, I really</p>
        <p>can&rsquo;t see what territory <em>The Last Mile Ramblers</em> might call   their own. They don&rsquo;t</p>
        <p>seem primarily interested   in either of those fields&mdash;or, for that matter, in   any</p>
        <p>particular field. And if   they were, I&rsquo;m not sure it would exactly be the right   direction.</p>
        <p>I&rsquo;m not sure anybody really   needs another recording of either &ldquo;Take Me Back To</p>
        <p>Tulsa&rdquo; or &ldquo;Twenty   Flight Rock.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; As a dance band, they   can, of course, use that whole spectrum. But the best   of</p>
        <p>the dance bands&mdash;Bob Wills   comes to mind&mdash;created their own material. And</p>
        <p>that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;d like to see <em>The Last Mile Ramblers</em> do. With   the kind of knowledge</p>
        <p>(and skill) they have, I   think a solid block of original material could move them   from</p>
        <p>being probably the best   honky-tonk dance band in the Albuquerque/Santa Fe area   to</p>
        <p>God-knows-how-far.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; Their Blue Canyon single is original material. &ldquo;The   Hurrier I Go (The Behinder I</p>
        <p>Get)&rdquo; is a truck-driving   song written by Jim Mares, a truck-driver friend of   theirs</p>
        <p>from Houston. That record also   stars Slim Pickens doing a couple of lines. The   other</p>
        <p>side is called &ldquo;Come A   Little Closer&rdquo; and is written and sung by J.B. The   truck-</p>
        <p>driving song got   encouraging airplay nationally and is mostly about the   energy</p>
        <p>crisis and the lowering of   the speed limit. It&rsquo;s almost a novelty tune and with   my</p>
        <p>prejudice against novelty   tunes, I prefer the other side. J.B.&rsquo;s side is a   classic</p>
        <p>mournful slow dancing   song.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; Both sides of the single   and two other originals are on the album&mdash;along with   a</p>
        <p>balance of non-original   dancing pieces. The first cut is probably my favorite; it&rsquo;s   a</p>
        <p>vastly up-tempo&mdash;almost   rock&mdash;and eerie &ldquo;Ghost Riders In The Sky.&rdquo; Spook   does</p>
        <p>the vocal; Spook also does   the vocal on his own &ldquo;The Golden Inn Song&rdquo;&mdash;which is   a</p>
        <p>tribute to their Sunday   afternoon bar and audience. Spook has a deep voice with   an</p>
        <p>urgency to it something on   the order of Waylon Jennings. His third vocal is   Waylon</p>
        <p>and Willie Nelson&rsquo;s   &ldquo;Good-Hearted Woman.&rdquo; J.B. does the other deep-voice   material,</p>
        <p>but his voice comes on more   like, say, Dave Dudley than Waylon Jennings. He does   a</p>
        <p>couple of truck-driving   songs: &ldquo;Phantom 309&rdquo; and &ldquo;Diesel Smoke (Dangerous   Curves)&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ndash;as well as his own &ldquo;Come A   Little Closer.&rdquo; George does the vocal on the other   truck</p>
        <p>song&mdash;&ldquo;The Hurrier I Go.&rdquo;   George is the member of the band usually most interested   in</p>
        <p>talking about their music.   George&rsquo;s father had a country band back east, Slats and   the</p>
        <p>Prairie Rangers, and he has   an extensive background in country music. George   also</p>
        <p>sings &ldquo;Out Of Control&rdquo; and   &ldquo;Future On Ice&rdquo;&mdash;both pretty much traditional   radio-type</p>
        <p>songs from a few years   back.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; I told George once that a   lot of people in Texas seem to think Al Dean wrote </p>
        <p>&ldquo;Cotton-Eyed Joe&rdquo; and   George told me that in a lot of ways, he did. That the   version</p>
        <p>Al Dean recorded is so much   different from the traditional fiddle tune that it   could</p>
        <p>almost be considered new.   &ldquo;Cotton-Eyed Joe&rdquo; is on the album as well as   another</p>
        <p>instrumental,&ldquo;Fresh Fish,&rdquo;   which Steve wrote with Mason Williams. Steve and   J.B.</p>
        <p>arranged their version of   &ldquo;Cotton-Eyed Joe.&rdquo; Of all the Ramblers, Steve&rsquo;s voice   and</p>
        <p>approach seems to me to be   the most nearly bluegrass. He does the vocal on a </p>
        <p>bluegrass &ldquo;Nine-Pound   Hammer&rdquo;&mdash;and, of course, supplies banjo on the rest   of</p>
        <p>the   album.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; Charlie sings on the   other bluegrass-like vocal, &ldquo;Tennessee&rdquo;&mdash;and a very   affective</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Roly Poly.&rdquo; Though I&rsquo;d   stick by my original contention that the world&rsquo;s   already</p>
        <p>heard Bob Wills do &ldquo;Roly   Poly&rdquo; and that&rsquo;s about the only one we need, I   think</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Roly Poly&rdquo; is second only   to &ldquo;Ghost Riders&rdquo; on the album.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; <em>While They Last </em>was recorded at the Blue   Canyon Studiol in Las   Vegas; at John</p>
        <p>Wagner&rsquo;s in Albuquerque; live at Liberty Hall in Houston; and live at the   Golden</p>
        <p>Inn. It&rsquo;s a good showcase of   the kind of thing you can hear of a Sunday afternoon</p>
        <p>at Golden and at the other   area bars where the Ramblers play&mdash;and that&rsquo;s high&mdash;</p>
        <p>energy, good-humored and   serious country music. &mdash; <em>by   R.G.</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&nbsp;</em></p>
