                  <p align="center"><i><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The 
                    whole aim of practical politics is to keep the populace alarmed 
                    (and hence clamorous to be led to safety) by menacing it with 
                    an endless series of hobgoblins...&quot; -H.L. Mencken</font></i></p>
                  <p> An Internet search finds 13,500 entries under &quot;demagoguery&quot; 
                    and almost 16,000 for &quot;demagogue&quot;, yet most people 
                    are not familiar with the term. Webster's definition of a 
                    demagogue is &quot;one who seeks to gain personal or partisan 
                    advantage by specious or extravagant claims, promises or charges.&quot;</p>
                  <p>Steven Soderbergh's new star-studded but low-budget film, 
                    <i>&quot;Young Demagogues' School,&quot;</i> employs a broader 
                    meaning of the word, encompassing advertising, corporate and 
                    political public relations and propaganda, euphemism, calculated 
                    rectitude and good-old-boyism and deceitful punditry of all 
                    sorts. I'll go along with this more inclusive definition, 
                    since it covers the whole range of media manipulation and 
                    spin control which assaults and attempts to mislead us on 
                    a daily basis.</p>
                  <p>The premise of this new Miramax release is best described 
                    by a 1998 cartoon that appeared in The New Yorker: A small 
                    child in a suit and tie is declaiming self-righteously at 
                    a tiny lectern, his right hand raised in oath-taking position, 
                    while his mother, watching from the next room, says to a friend, 
                    &quot;With the Suzuki method, they start them campaigning 
                    as early as three or four.&quot;</p>
                  <p>In <i>&quot;Young Demagogue's School,&quot;</i> an exclusive 
                    prep school evidently located somewhere in upstate New York 
                    prepares young people to practice the skills of deceit which 
                    seek to dominate our political, commercial, cultural and even 
                    emotional lives, and which prop up the &quot;culture war&quot; 
                    which has replaced the external enemies of the Cold War.</p>
                  <p>In the &quot;Rush Limbaugh Master Class,&quot; young demagogues-in-training 
                    are guided in the fine art of demonizing their opponents. 
                    In this disturbing sequence, Haley Joel Osment (the wonderful 
                    young co-star of <i>&quot;The Sixth Sense&quot;</i>) draws 
                    a classmate's name from a hat, silently peruses a questionnaire 
                    listing her views on such mundane things as sports, fast food 
                    and music, and then cheerfully turns everything he knows about 
                    her into a withering attack on her character, intelligence 
                    and intentions -- almost as skillfully as the &quot;master&quot; 
                    himself. </p>
                  <p>Osment's mentor in this scene, Susan Sarandon (playing very 
                    much against type, or at least against her own real-life progressive 
                    political stance), combines a seemingly motherly instinct 
                    with a scary understanding of the manipulative techniques 
                    of advertising and P.R., and a ruthless determination to instill 
                    it in her young subjects.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p> Another frightening but funny sequence has Sarandon and 
                    her ditzy co-instructor, Annette Bening, leading the rowdy 
                    class through an exercise in framing a series of heinous political 
                    and corporate acts as good things we can't possibly live without, 
                    using the warm, fuzzy, soft-focus, saccharine-piano, &quot;Morning 
                    in America&quot; TV ad approach that seems to work so well 
                    for everything from ketchup to candidates -- and in giving 
                    them euphemistic, saleable titles. </p>
                  <p>The flip side, portraying good acts and initiatives as the 
                    greatest threats to democracy since Adolph Hitler, is practiced 
                    by our young demagogues using the growling, threatening, rumbling 
                    commercial style heard so often in political &quot;issue ad&quot; 
                    campaigns. Watching the students master these techniques and 
                    voices is at once fascinating and disquieting.</p>
                  <p>What emerges throughout the film is a bleak, sardonic view 
                    of a world controlled by spin doctors and their manipulative 
                    ads, phony news stories and industry-sponsored &quot;astroturf&quot; 
                    (as opposed to real &quot;grassroots&quot;) citizen group 
                    campaigns. This is the Kafkaesque universe parodied weekly 
                    in Tom Tomorrow's comic strip, <i>This Modern World</i>, and 
                    by such cartoons as one that appeared in Time Magazine after 
                    Hillary Clinton's health care plan bit the dust in an industry-orchestrated 
                    orgy of recrimination: <i>&quot;Then came the TV scare ads: 
                    'The Government wants to tear down our health care system 
                    and force us to have surgery performed by Motor Vehicle Bureau 
                    clerks!!'&quot;</i></p>
                  <p>As owner and headmaster of the Young Demagogues' School, 
                    Martin Sheen (in a sharp departure from his usual television 
                    role as a liberal US President) does a chilling turn as a 
                    Machiavellian proponent of mastering demagoguery both as a 
                    career skill and as a defense against other demagogues. His 
                    simultaneous pursuit of both Bening and seductive student 
                    LeeLee Sobieski (Joan of Arc), effortlessly conducted behind 
                    the back of his hapless wife, Julia Roberts, represents an 
                    Oscar&reg;-worthy performance for both Sheen and Bening.</p>
                  <p>Special mention is due to the ubiquitous Russell Crowe, who, 
                    in an amusing but unsettling sequence as the school's only 
                    male instructor (oddly, involved in none of the romantic or 
                    murderous sub-plots swirling around the other characters), 
                    tutors young Rory Culkin (late of <i>You Can Count on Me</i>) 
                    and Sobieski in the use of biting but innocuous-sounding &quot;code 
                    words,&quot; in pretending to attentively listen to and advise 
                    a clueless President while in fact telling him what to think, 
                    and in subtly re-stating an opponent's position in terms that 
                    make him seem heartless and ignorant. </p>
                  <p>In fact, virtually all the tools of the advertising and PR 
                    trades are starkly exposed in this funny and touching yet 
                    disturbing film, which will premiere nationally later this 
                    month.</p>
                  <p>Actually, this movie will appear about the same time they 
                    make a film about America's most interesting character, Ben 
                    Franklin -- which is to say, probably never. But I can dream, 
                    can't I?</p>

          <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Dear Dr. Laura,</font></p>
          <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I believe you 
            truly outdid yourself today. If I understood you correctly, you were 
            complaining that because you have been misrepresented and misquoted 
            so often in the press, you are living proof that journalists have 
            lost all credibility, and that the press therefore does not deserve 
            and will not have for long the particular freedoms guaranteed to it 
            by the Constitution.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Having disparaged 
            (contrary to your oft-repeated admonitions to your listeners not to 
            be disparaging, hateful or impolite) librarians, psychiatrists, school 
            teachers, etc., now you're starting in on journalists.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I doubt that 
            you know any journalists personally, other than the right-wing sources 
            you referred to today, and you certainly never would have made it 
            as a journalist (or a school teacher, librarian, etc.). How about 
            a little appreciation and understanding for people who have hard, 
            generally thankless jobs, often much more difficult and less ego-gratifying 
            than yours?</font></p>
          <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">If you knew any 
            working journalists, or ever hung around a newsroom for even a few 
            hours, you would find out how hard most journalists work to confirm 
            facts. Not every report and allegation is open to the three confirmations 
            you demand (at least for any stories involving you), but shouldn't 
            we hold you to the same standards that you demand of journalists? 
            </font></p>
          <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> Compare the 
            level of accuracy and objectivity of the press to the slander and 
            generalizations about large groups of people that you spew daily (your 
            latest favorite: Democrats!). You have no room to criticize a profession 
            which by training and habit, makes a tremendous effort to be accurate 
            and objective. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Your statement, 
            "There is no serious journalism; it's getting so bad that there soon 
            may not be any constitutional protection for journalists" certainly 
            must make you feel good, but it's a self-fulfilling prophecy for people 
            like you, who can't handle the existence of news and views that you 
            don't agree with.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> You said today, 
            "I can't support the press having special privileges". Oh really? 
            How about talk show hosts? They aren't even mentioned specifically 
            in the Constitution, as the press is. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I hate to be 
            anywhere near paranoid, but is it any coincidence that just as a Bush 
            presidency emerged, right-wing pundits like yourself began floating 
            more and more openly the idea that the press could use a few restrictions? 
            You quote the statistic that 32 percent of Americans support some 
            restrictions on the press, as though there is some objective "truth" 
            that a Big Brother government can guarantee. You, of all people, should 
            be horrified at this prospect.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">If another Democratic 
            administration were in power, with the kind of authoritarian control 
            over the press that you and other right-wingers dream of, you would 
            be damn thankful that the press is guaranteed its freedom, even given 
            their all-too-human margin of error and bias that we all must put 
            up with. If somebody has reported inaccurately or unfavorably on you, 
            why don't you just shrug it off as everybody in the public eye has 
            to do from time to time, instead of palpitating at the prospect of 
            a muzzled press? </font></p>
          <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Someone who freely 
            admits that she gets her news and views from Rush Limbaugh (as you 
            did on November 21) is in no position to criticize people who generally 
            do make a serious, professional effort to be accurate and balanced. 
            On that same day I heard you say about Rush, after quoting his crackpot 
            view on something or other: "He's been in the business long enough 
            to know what he's talking about." </font></p>
          <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">You do realize 
            what business he's in, don't you? He's in the business of demonizing 
            "liberals" and glorifying "conservatives," regardless of any fact 
            or view which might run contrary to that thesis, for the gratification 
            of people who like a simple, black-and-white political and social 
            analysis.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In fact, Rush 
            has done something brilliant, if evil: As you know, many adults as 
            well as children and adolescents live with the natural ongoing questions, 
            "Where do I fit in?" What's right? How should I act? Who am I? What 
            distinguishes me from others? </font></p>
          <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> Rush brilliantly 
            answers those questions with a comprehensive, well-constructed mythology 
            and value system, which you seem to have adopted from him: Conservatives/Republicans 
            are good, generous, moderate, fair-minded, sensible, hard-working, 
            family-oriented, God-fearing, self-reliant, temperate and reasonable 
            - - as opposed to liberals/Democrats. (Lately you have even taken 
            to using Al Gore as your metaphor for everything evil, amoral and 
            duplicitous!)</font></p>
          <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Liberals, on 
            the other hand, have no comparable mythology, and no spokesman as 
            clever and popular as Rush to spew it, with no bevy of clones such 
            as yourself to repeat it and expand upon it. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">You might want 
            to consider whether the corporate interests who typically support 
            the Republican Party and their supposed agenda of self-reliance, responsibility, 
            "family," "community," and the future, are really committed to those 
            things. If they were, they would not be the same people who do whatever 
            they can to plunder the earth and its people, based on unrealistic, 
            unsustainable assumptions about population and consumer growth, to 
            meet the immediate demands of the bottom line at all costs. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The best instincts 
            and aspirations of good-hearted Christians, Republicans and other 
            "middle Americans" have been successfully co-opted by conservative 
            Republicans and corporate operatives and ideologues, often by creating 
            phony "grassroots" citizen groups in order to appear legitimate.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Every time you 
            talk about one of your favorite nemeses--gay or environmental activists, 
            librarians, psychiatrists, liberals, etc.--and say "what they really 
            want...", "what they're really doing..." or "what their real agenda 
            is...", you should know that you're generally wrong, and that you're 
            slandering and demeaning people. But you do it anyway, since you have 
            the platform and enough yes-sayers to make you feel good about it 
            in spite of whatever conscience you may have.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Many years ago 
            I underwent a process called "rebirthing," essentially a rapid-breathing 
            process which tends to bring up whatever buried sources of sadness 
            or conflict are nearest the surface. What unexpectedly overwhelmed 
            me was a feeling of great sadness for having bought in to the anti-"Establishment" 
            rhetoric of my college days, which had caused me to dismiss and demean 
            an entire segment of the population, many of them perfectly honorable 
            and sincere. It had evidently made me feel good to demonize them, 
            but I now regret this profoundly, and endeavor to avoid making the 
            same mistake again. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In the spirit 
            of Lee Atwater, the conservative attack dog who found himself on his 
            deathbed tearfully asking forgiveness for all the havoc he'd wrought, 
            I'd recommend you consider doing the same.</font></p>

          It was a sunny childhood, full of warmth, closeness and gay laughter.

          Into this emotional vacuum stepped Steve Allen, with his weekly variety 
          show on NBC-TV. (Mr. Allen died October 30, peacefully in his sleep, 
          thank God.) Like the Beatles years later, Steve Allen's zaniness and 
          intelligence was a lifeline of hope for me in a barren, mostly humorless 
          world. <br>
          </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The fact that Mr. 
          Allen was also well on his way to writing the 8,500 songs and 53 books 
          he eventually authored, the fact that he was a serious crusader who 
          was always aware of the social and political context in which he lived, 
          were things I wasn't aware of at the time. Or perhaps I just assumed 
          they were normal for public figures, which of course they are not.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What I was aware 
          of was his irrepressible wit and spontaneity. Even today he is credited 
          not only with having invented the late-night talk show (he originated 
          the Tonight Show), but he's acknowledged as being the greatest ad-libber 
          of all time. Irreverent, totally non-linear, he refused to take anything 
          seriously. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here's his delivery 
          of an ad for Coldene Stick Chest Rub, whose teleprompter script was 
          a straight pitch for avoiding the "greasy, gooey mess" of "ordinary 
          greasy rubs."</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Allen: "Say, do 
          you smear your youngsters like this when they have a cold? Do they smear 
          you right back? Gets pretty gooey, doesn't it? Well, friends, stick 
          by those gooey kids of yours. They're the best friend your car ever 
          had. But finally somebody has taken the grease and messiness out, and 
          put grit and grime back in.<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here's 
          what I mean, and I wish I knew. It's called Coldene Stick Chest Rub, 
          and you just stick it in your old rubbery chest.</font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Watch 
          how to avoid the messiness and discomfort of eating fried chicken with 
          your bare hands. Your fingers never even touch it. That's right. The 
          whole operation is handled by your toes...."</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Allen sent me an 
          autographed copy of his book, "<i>How to be Funny; discovering the comic 
          you</i>," in which this and many other such items appear, a few years 
          ago, after I had sent him a note letting him know how much he meant 
          to me and millions of others of my generation. He also put me on his 
          list to receive his frequent mailings of clippings on the many issues 
          he felt were important -- underlined and asterisked.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Several months later 
          I invited him to attend a film-and-video networking event here in Santa 
          Fe called "Schmoozarama '96." He sent his regrets and best wishes in 
          an open letter which began as follows:</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Having devoted 
          a good part of my life to schmoozing and a not insignificant portion 
          of my energies to ramming I am naturally not loathe - whatever that 
          means - to participate in the general encouragement of whatever it is 
          that you people are up to. On the general understanding that nothing 
          you are doing is either illegal or immoral you may count me among your 
          supporters..."</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the outpouring 
          of articles and testimonials that followed Mr. Allen's death, many of 
          his colleagues and friends spoke not only about his incredible wit and 
          his extraordinary output as a Renaissance Man, but about his kindness 
          and decency, his warmth and gentlemanliness. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As for his social 
          concerns (his latest one being the rise of vulgarity in entertainment 
          and media) he never stopped, and he was crusading in crisp, clear, erudite 
          sentences right up to his last week. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A friend of his 
          wrote that the two seminal experiences of Allen's life were the gratitude 
          he felt at being treated to a cup of coffee and a hot dog when he was 
          cold and homeless one night at age 16, and the tearful gratitude he 
          felt when he found out that his wife, Jayne, did not have cancer after 
          all. Allen, an agnostic, speculated that the earliest prayers of primitive 
          man were probably prayers of gratitude.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">With that deep sense 
          of gratitude for a life well-lived and for a true role model and inspiration, 
          I say thank you and goodbye, Steve. You'll never know what a difference 
          you made. </font></p>

            </b>By Jim Terr <br>
            </font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>(As published 
            in the Eldorado Sun, Santa Fe, NM, November 2000 issue, monthly column 
            "Don't Get Me Started")</i></font></p>
          <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Not to disappoint 
            any of my fans, but I've decided to give up my moralistic, self-righteous, 
            idealistic tone and take a new approach to making a difference in 
            this weary world. I've decided to stop sitting at the sidelines, sniping 
            at the politicians and pundits who pollute the airwaves, press and 
            public arena. I've decided to get down into the mudpit myself. </font></p>
          <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Yes, you heard 
            it here first: I'm going to run for office! And I'm going to be pragmatic 
            about it. </font></p>
          <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Having examined 
            the platforms of two major candidates who demonstrated almost mathematically 
            impossible, amazingly identical levels of appeal, I have decided to 
            adopt those elements which I think endeared each of them to almost 
            50 per cent of the voting public. Yes, I, too, want to be that well-loved, 
            and I want to serve you, the People, my friends, the working families 
            that inhabit the Breadbasket, the Rust Belt, the Silicon Valleys, 
            the Great Desert, and the Right and Left Coasts of this great nation. 
            </font></p>
          <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now, I'm not talking 
            about plundering their official "platforms" and policy papers formulated 
            for the twenty or thirty policy wonks and reporters who bothered to 
            examine them. I doubt that these detailed tomes were even familiar 
            to the candidates themselves (one of them in particular.) </font></p>
          <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">No, I'm talking 
            about what they projected, what they conveyed, those subtly-coded 
            messages, ably-telegraphed qualities and often-repeated themes that 
            really drew in the voters. </font></p>
          <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">From Al Gore I've 
            learned above all that you must be knowledgeable (a quality that's 
            not easy to fake, but if George W. Bush can do it I can do it). No 
            matter how much you project a good-old-boy, I'll-take-care-of-you-like-your-favorite-uncle 
            image, the American people still have a sneaking suspicion that the 
            presidency is a high-powered executive position where some brain power 
            might be useful. And I certainly have that; you can take my word for 
            it. </font></p>
          <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If pressed, I'll 
            even promise, like Gore, to do something about campaign finance reform. 
            I think that the current system of corporate financing, of not getting 
            the needs of you, The People, American Families, taken care of, just 
            because you don't have the big bucks to contribute a in order to get 
            the attention you deserve -- I think that's rotten, don't you? Just 
            watch me do something about it! </font></p>
          <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And Mr. Bush, 
            what a master! Dumb like a fox! If you're ever lucky enough to meet 
            me in person you'll quickly appreciate that I, too, am just a regular 
            guy. Just like you, in fact, except that I have exceptional skills 
            at bringing people together and I'm extraordinarily honest -- honest! 
            </font></p>
          <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Not a brainiac 
            like that smarty Al Gore, but gifted with natural wisdom, common sense 
            and penetrating vision into the failings of the political system: 
            I'll take power from the Ivy League intellectuals and social schemers 
            who run Washington, and give it back to you, The People. You know 
            what to do with your money, you know how to build roads and control 
            air traffic and protect our vital oil interests in the Mideast far 
            better than those pointy-headed beancounters. </font></p>
          <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You know better 
            than the Washington Establishment how to direct research at the National 
            Institutes of Health, and how to turn those expensive findings over 
            to private pharmaceutical companies so they can patent them and make 
            huge profits while gouging you for all you're worth. I have faith 
            in you, The People. </font></p>
          <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Like Mr. Bush, 
            I believe in accountability and responsibility, except perhaps in 
            the case of corporate polluters and insolvent corporations and lenders, 
            who sometimes need a helping hand for the good of all of us. </font></p>
          <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And from both 
            of these fine men I've learned that you don't want to hear about a 
            single-payer health care system, or to even discuss how well it may 
            or may not have worked in Marxist countries such as Canada. The American 
            Experience is unique, and we shall blaze our own path. Some day we 
            may even have a health care and retirement plan as fine and generous 
            as that of the Congress, who wouldn't be caught dead with the Social 
            Security or health care systems that they're fine-tuning for you. 
            </font></p>
          <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And I've learned 
            a few things from the crashing failure of Ralph Nader's campaign, 
            as well. Unliveable wages, world starvation and disease, the giveaway 
            of the public's airwaves, corporate domination of government, media 
            and culture, having the world's largest prison population -- BORRING!! 
            </font></p>
          <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So tell those 
            professional politicians in Washington you've had enough, that you're 
            ready for a fresh face and a bold new approach. Tell them to step 
            aside cuz Jim is in the house! Start organizing, start a dialogue

  <P ALIGN="left"><FONT SIZE="+1"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There 
    is only so much I can absorb about crime, education, Social Security, guns, 
    abortion and school vouchers, especially when the candidates' positions often 
    seem to reflect polling and focus group data more than personal passion and 
    original thinking. And how much of what's said on the campaign trail will 
    really be translated into policy, anyway? I've often toyed with what questions 
    I would ask candidates for national office if I could sit down with them and 
    really get them to answer. (And in fact I do have a rather risky and expensive 
    scheme to actually address some jarring questions to the candidates.) </font></FONT></P>
  <P ALIGN="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Some of the 
    following questions are intended to help me probe the candidates' values, 
    priorities, introspectiveness and candor, some to bring attention to issues 
    not being addressed, and some just to see if they know what I'm talking about:</font></P>
  <P ALIGN="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Are you 
    concerned that the average American CEO now makes 475 times what the average 
    worker makes (10 times the 1980 figure), while doing all he can to minimize 
    wages and benefits and send jobs overseas if possible? Is there any behavior 
    or level of personal wealth that you would define as greed? Do you believe 
    most Americans are better off economically than they were 20 years ago? </font></P>
  <P ALIGN="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What do you 
    think about the strictures on social behavior and public policy necessitated 
    by our litigious society? What are your thoughts on the bureaucratic and corporate 
    mindset that seems to negate employees' creative, spontaneous, intuitive and 
    generous instincts? How do you feel about "instant" Internet voting? </font></P>
  <P ALIGN="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">How many 
    people starve to death in the world each day? When was the last time you addressed 
    this in a speech or interview? How much death, illness, oppression and other 
    misery is caused worldwide by US government and corporate policy, in your 
    estimation? </font></P>
  <P ALIGN="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Do you feel 
    that Americans care about and depend upon the welfare of others in the world? 
    Do you think the American people would appreciate your leaving a legacy of 
    environmental, economic and social justice, world peace, democracy, and a 
    worldwide living wage? Do you think that such a focus would provide maximum 
    security for Americans as well? </font></P>
  <P ALIGN="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Do you think 
    that the interests of "Wall Street" are inherently different from those of 
    "Main Street", and that the current system of campaign finance and "soft money" 
    tilts the balance of influence to corporate interests at the expense of citizens? 
    </font></P>
  <P ALIGN="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Are you concerned 
    about the fear-and-misinformation industry, phony corporate and advocacy front 
    groups, and the politicization of health, nutrition and consumer information? 
    Do you think of federal lands as being owned by the government or by the public?</font></P>
  <P ALIGN="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">How do you 
    feel about radar detectors? Taxing Internet sales? Universal health care? 
    Have you ever been attracted to someone of the same sex, even momentarily 
    or mistakenly? Do you think marijuana causes more havoc than alcohol? Do you 
    think global warming is a fiction? Do you feel that most gun control advocates 
    are really bent on elimination of private gun ownership? </font></P>
  <P ALIGN="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When did 
    you last listen to "Prairie Home Companion?" How about "Click and Clack, the 
    Tappet Brothers"? Are you concerned about the growing proportion of business 
    and financial news on PBS-TV and National Public Radio, relative to the truly 
    alternative political, economic and environmental content that characterized 
    their founding? </font></P>
  <P ALIGN="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Are you aware 
    of the rapid reduction and pollution of water supplies and water tables, including 
    in the US? When was the last time you expressed concern about this in a speech 
    or interview? Does your family have a private source of water that does not 
    depend on the same water supplies as the rest of us? </font></P>
  <P ALIGN="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">How do you 
    feel about Tacitus' statement that "The more numerous the laws, the more corrupt 
    the state"? Do you have any ideas on reducing the body of law to a level such 
    that the average citizen can get through life on her best civic and social 
    instincts, without retaining an attorney? How do you feel about Mark Twain's 
    statement that "It's getting harder and harder to assemble a jury, because 
    it's getting so hard to find 12 people who don't know anything and can't read"? 
    How about Thomas Jefferson's warning that corporations should be strictly 
    limited in their size, power and duration, and should never be accorded the 
    rights of citizens? </font></P>
  <P ALIGN="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Do you feel 
    that TV and movie violence encourages violent behavior? Do you think that 
    excessive TV and video games are reducing children's ability to think, read 
    and socialize? If so, when was the last time you addressed this in a speech 
    or interview?</font></P>
  <P ALIGN="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In matters 
    such as honesty, trust, civility, Constitutional and historical knowledge, 
    littering, voting, debate, handicapped parking and running stop signs, do 
    you think the average person is getting more--or less--civic-minded? </font></P>
  <P ALIGN="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Would you 
    desire a different punishment for someone who robbed your mother of her life 
    savings, depending on whether they stole it physically or "with a fountain 
    pen?" </font></P>
  <P ALIGN="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What do you 
    think of the idea of having the prosecution and defense decide and declare 
    before a verdict is delivered, whether the trial was fair and proper, rather 
    than automatically requesting an appeal or mistrial if the verdict doesn't 
    go their way? </font></P>
  <P ALIGN="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Well, now 
    that that's over, let's go to Starbucks to discuss the decline of local businesses 
    at the expense of national and multi-national chains. I'll buy! </font></P>

          (reprinted by permission)</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> <i><font size="3">Think 
          the days of thousand-dollar hammers and screwdrivers and bolts are gone? 
          Wrong. The Pentagon loses ships: they do not know where they are.... 
          The Pentagon cannot even have their books audited to figure out how 
          they are spending their money, yet we are giving them more money. (Republican 
          Budget Committee chairman, John Kasich, on the House floor, March 23, 
          2000)</font></i></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> We 
          recently saw Congress's response to the growing crisis in waste and 
          inefficiency at the Pentagon. The House overwhelmingly authorized a 
          record $309.9 billion for the Defense Department, $4.5 billion over 
          the President's request and an increase of $21.1 billion from last year. 
          Pathetically, an amendment to put some pressure on the Pentagon brass 
          to reign in waste with a 1percent reduction in procurement and research 
          and development was rejected 331 to 88. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">President 
          Clinton bears much of the responsibility for the run up in Pentagon 
          spending. He has recommended increases in Pentagon spending in 6of his 
          8 budget proposals. However, in an effort not to be outdone by thePresident 
          they call a "draft dodger," the Republican majority, since taking over 
          Congress in 1994, has trumped his requests with another $41.8 billion 
          in unrequested increases. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Kasich 
          justifies the increases despite his devastating criticism of waste at 
          the Pentagon by saying: "We do not want our people in uniform to pay 
          the price for sloppy management inside the Pentagon." </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Unfortunately, 
          it is the men and women in the ranks who are suffering along with millions 
          of average Americans who have seen vital programs and benefits cut to 
          finance Pentagon waste. More than 16,000 enlisted families still qualify 
          for food stamps. I met the father of a Marine shopping for a waterproof 
          bag for his son's fancy digital field radio--the Pentagon could only 
          afford a garbage bag. Officers during the Gulf War called home to ask 
          their families to buy hand-held Global Positioning Satellite units the 
          Pentagon couldn't provide.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> It 
          is the same old "Iron Triangle" President Eisenhower warned us about, 
          back with a vengeance forty years later. Newt Gingrich forced the purchase 
          of unneeded C-130s to benefit his District. Trent Lott has forced the 
          building of an unrequested air craft carrier to benefit a shipyard in 
          his home state. Despite $50 billion spent without a single successful 
          honest test, Ronald Reagan's Star Wars fantasy is being pushed toward 
          deployment, jeopardizing the ABM and START treaties. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Recently, 
          a report leaked from a special panel of defense-contractor executives 
          established by the Pentagon to study problems with their industry. "Industry 
          management and government share responsibility for the problem. Fixing 
          these problems is critical to our future national security." Unfortunately, 
          this is not an enlightened report about the waste and inefficiency in 
          procurement. It is a report bemoaning the low stock prices and lack 
          of profitability for defense contractors. Among the solutions: Pay contractors 
          to merge, downsize and lay off workers and reward executives, boards 
          of directors and stockholders for these efforts; cut "barriers" to sophisticated 
          arms exports; rein in whistle blowers, and raise profit levels. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">George 
          W. Bush is alarmed about our "hollow military," promising large increases 
          in spending for the Pentagon, and Al Gore is following in Clinton's 
          footsteps on this issue. Congress has given up any pretense of wanting 
          any restraint at the Pentagon. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">During 
          budget deliberations earlier this year, as Chair of the Congressional 
          Progressive Caucus (CPC), I offered an alternative federal budget proposal 
          that made prudent reductions in military spending totalling $30 billion 
          in order to more adequately fund education, health care, housing, infrastructure 
          repair and veterans' and seniors' programs, among other priorities. 
          Many of the reductions were based on the work of Larry Korb, Assistant 
          Secretary of Defense under Ronald Reagan, who has calculated a strong 
          national defense should only cost around $225 billion a year. The CPC 
          budget won only 61 votes.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Looks 
          like we'll be waiting a few more years for the post-cold war "peace 
          dividend." </font></p>

            MY FAITH</b> <br>
            by Jim Terr <br>
          </p>
        </div>
        <p align="center"><i>(continued from Home page)</i></p>
        <p>I am not gauging this by my own microscopic understanding of physics, 
          biology, organic chemistry, etc., but rather by the comprehension exhibited 
          by the wisest people in all such fields. To the best of my knowledge, 
          most of them profess progressively greater wonder at the mystery and 
          Grand Design of life, the deeper they dig and the more they understand.</p>
        <p>The example that always comes to mind is the struggle of scientists 
          to create in the laboratory simple proteins, the simplest building blocks 
          of all organisms. </p>
        <p>Forget about skin, circulatory systems, digestive systems, nervous 
          systems thousands of times more complex and subtle than the most sophisticated 
          computer. Forget about the ability to think, to grow, reproduce, fight 
          disease, sleep and heal. Just creating a basic unit of protein has proven 
          almost impossible to the most skilled and well-equipped scientists.</p>
        <p>And I have no problem accepting the existence of a higher being, a 
          higher intelligence, a vaster design. Why should I? Does accepting this 
          diminish my own experience of joy, of power, of opportunity? Am I, as 
          a person, any less wondrous than an ocean, a river, a cloudy sky or 
          the infinite heavens? I certainly dont feel so; in fact, I feel in 
          awe of all of them, not to mention my own body.</p>
        <p>Fortunately, I wasnt raised with any exaggerated notion of human grandeur, 
          independence or supremacy, of Mans dominion over nature. I think that 
          the conscious or unconscious assumption of my parents, and of the immediate 
          culture in which I was raised, was that people are a wondrous cog in 
          a wondrous system called Life and Nature, here to enjoy that system 
          while we can. So the idea of God or of a higher intelligence behind 
          that system is perfectly acceptable, and in no way demeans my own feelings 
          of self-esteem.</p>
        <p>Neither do I feel that my belief in God or a higher intelligence is 
          simply a wishful adult projection of the childlike state of dependency 
          on a father figure. It simply seems obvious and natural, or at least 
          convenient, to posit and believe in a higher power. </p>
        <p>As I am more powerful and comprehending than a baby, and a baby presumably 
          more powerful and complex than a twig, so do I think it likely that 
          there is a much more complex system and a more powerful consciousness 
          of which I am a part, and it feels quite natural to think so. And if 
          there is a higher consciousness, why can I not tap into it--and sometimes 
          even get a response to a request--by prayer and mediation? In fact, 
          I often do. Somehow Ive never had the impression of the lines of communication 
          being jammed or clogged at any given moment. </p>
        <p>As a final note, I was raised a Jew in small Christian communities, 
          in the 1950s and 1960s, before the concept of the separation of church 
          and state was extended to mean no religious expression for anyone in 
          the public sphere. I loved singing Christmas carols, I loved exchanging 
          gifts at Christmas (of course), and my later appreciation of my own 
          religious heritage was in no way stunted or diluted. I thank God that 
          no one was watching out for my right to avoid all religions at that 
          time. </p>
