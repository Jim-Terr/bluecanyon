	<strong>VIDEO CLAIMS STRAIGHT FEEDBACK FROM FORMER TRUMP ASSOCIATES<br></strong></span>

			<span lang="en-US"><span style="font-weight: normal">In April of 
			2024 Las Vegas NM filmmaker Jim Terr wrote to 25 former Trump 
			employees and associates who have publicly criticized the 
			ex-president, asking them to interview for a project called "Trump 
			Experts Speak Out." "My idea," Terr says, "was that all these 
			first-hand critiques should be in one place, where they can be seen 
			and considered." <br><br>The project's website,
			<a href="http://www.TrumpExperts.com/">www.TrumpExperts.com</a>, is 
			headed: "Need a mechanic? Dentist? President? Ask for references!"</span></span></font></font></p>
			<p style="line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: 0.14in">
			<font face="Calibri, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt">
			<span lang="en-US"><span style="font-weight: normal">Only one 
			requested interviewee, Anthony Scaramucci, former White House 
			communications director and an investment fund manager in New York, 
			agreed to be interviewed. "And I'm glad he did," Terr says, "because 
			he provided a very honest, non-judgmental view of Trump's appeal, in 
			a thoughtful historical, psychological, and moral context, the 
			longest interview I've seen him do anywhere."</span></span></font></font></p>
			<p style="line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: 0.14in">
			<font face="Calibri, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt">
			<span lang="en-US"><span style="font-weight: normal">Eight other 
			ex-associates are portrayed by re-enactors in the 63-minute video, 
			quoting their actual words. Prior to being compiled into the final 
			video, these component interviews racked up over 70,000 views on 
			YouTube in one week. <br><br>Those include White House chief of 
			staff Gen. John Kelly, former secretary of state Rex Tillerson, 
			national security advisor John Bolton, communications director 
			Stephanie Grisham, personal lawyer Michael Cohen, national security 
			advisor H.R. McMaster, former White House attorney Ty Cobb, and 
			director of strategic communication Alyssa Farah Griffin, portrayed 
			in the video by “outed” CIA agent Valerie Plame, a New Mexico 
			resident who narrated Terr’s 2019 feature film, “The Brill Building 
			Movie.” </span></span></font></font></p>

			<font face="Calibri, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt">
			<span lang="en-US"><span style="font-weight: normal">Terr raised the 
			$12,000 budget to produce and publicize the project on Kickstarter, 
			and is making it available free for non-profit use on any platform 
			or venue, including movie theaters.</span></span></font></font></p>

			<font face="Calibri, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt">
			<span lang="en-US"><span style="font-weight: normal">In the final 
			minutes of his interview, Scaramucci says of the ex-president, "I 
			have never met in my life somebody as insecure as Donald Trump. And 
			this insecurity has manifested itself in this hyper-masculinity, in 
			the bullying and the demeaning of others. It's very un-American and 
			it's very uncharacteristic of what Americans like. Americans 
			typically like the underdog personality who is a go-for-it type of 
			person who loves other human beings and wants to pull people 
			together."<br><br>Terr says of Scaramucci's interview, "He really 
			added to my understanding of demagoguery, and I thought I was an 
			expert, as I've devoted my life to studying and warning about this, 
			about how politicians alarm people for their personal advancement."<br>
			<br>The video is dedicated to former president Jimmy Carter, and to 
			fellow filmmaker David Hoffman. </span></span></font></font></p>

			produced award-winning, foundation-funded documentaries on World War 
			Two veterans, Holocaust survivors, elder citizens, auto safety for 
			teens, and other subjects, as well as interviews with other news and 
			entertainment figures on his YouTube channel, which has over 2.5 
			million views to date. </span></span></font></font></p>
