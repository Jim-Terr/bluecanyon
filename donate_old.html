        <p align="center" class="style2"><span class="style8">BEN FRANKLIN HAD IT RIGHT</span><br>
            <br>
            <span class="style4">He was a funny writer, with a . . . taste for pseudonymous pranks; he hid his
  most ascerbic opinions behind the masks of made-up characters. But he had world-class
  ambitions, and he understood that these ambitions were probably best served
  by achievement . . . <br>
    <br>
  ...he understood that he would inevitably be viewed as a provincial, and that
  it paid to play the clown a little . . .The metropolis, while it mistrusts
  an upstart, forgives a lovable provincial eccentric. <br>
    <br>
  Franklin liked to write letters claiming to be from other people . . . in order
  to <span class="style12">dramatize some political point through obvious overload. </span>The last thing
  he wrote was a letter purportedly from a Muslim slaver . . . whose lust for
  slavery was intended to hold a mirror up to the American slaveholder's own,
  and shame him. <br>
    <br>
  Franklin was an instictive ironist . . . it was his natural mode . . . the
  whole thing depended on being reported with an absolutely straight face. It
  was not that he did not value honesty . . . He would have beem reluctant to
  to say something that he believed to be a lie. But, as a businessman and a
  writer and a diplomat, he might very well be willing to dramatize, or even
  overdramatize, something he believed to be essentially the truth. <br>
    <br>
  Franklin's essentially ironic, distancing turn of mind . . . gave him a kind
  of second sight into the minds of his hosts. There is little sham in French
  life, but a lot of show, a lot of rhetorical gesturing. Franklin understood
  this style instantly. He was pretending to be a naif . . ., which the French
  knew to be faux, and they were pretending to be worldly, which he knew to be
  an illusion. <br>
    <br>
  But the logic of power depends largely on the perceptions, the feelings, of
  the people who have it. Franklin understood that, above all, the good opinion
  of the French mattered. It paid to be liked and admired, and he made sure that
  he was. He knew that he could not make his country, and its needs, inescapable
  if he did not make himself, and his cause, irresistable. <br>
