		<b>Popular book about Las Vegas, New Mexico to become an audio book</b></font><br />
		<br />
		<i>WILDEST OF THE WILD WEST: True Tales of a Frontier Town on the Santa 
		Fe Trail</i> was first published in 1988 by Clear Light Publishers of 
		Santa Fe. Now it will be an audio book!<br />
		<br />
		Written by the late Albuquerque journalist and historian Howard Bryan, 
		the story of the incredibly violent and lawless history of Las Vegas, 
		New Mexico during its railroad boom years has sold tens of thousands of 
		copies and continues to be a Southwest best seller, one of the most 
		successful regionally published books ever. <br />
		<br />
		Noemi de Bodisco, owner of Op Cit Books in Santa Fe and Taos and Tome on 
		the Range in Las Vegas, says the book has always been a regional best 
		seller in all three of her stores, and agrees that its vivid content 
		should make it a perfect audio book. “We buy this book by the carton,” 
		she says, “Not in ones or twos.”<br />
		<br />
		Audio book producer Jim Terr, a native of Las Vegas, NM, says he was 
		attracted to the book as an audio project for exactly that reason. “The 
		stories are so vivid, so engaging – many nearly unbelievable – that I 
		think this will make the perfect audio book for driving, and hopefully 
		for drawing young adults into an awareness of history.” <br />
		<br />
		The audio version, voiced by Terr, an actor and documentary producer, 
		will be available on December 12, 2019 via </font><font color="#000080">

		<font face="Calibri, sans-serif">www.HookIntoHistory.com</font></a></u></span></font><font face="Calibri, sans-serif"> 
		, as well as on CD in bookstores. Book signings are scheduled in Santa 
		Fe, Albuquerque, Taos, and Las Vegas (see website).<br />
		<br />
		In his forward to the book, historian Max Evans says, “The hanging 
		windmill on the (Las Vegas) Old Town Plaza was used so often and so 
		publicly that its services to the community had to be voided as too 
		great a temptation. Little boys all over town were hanging their dogs in 
		imitation.”<br />
		<br />
		Doc Holliday, Billy the Kid, Bat Masterson, Jesse James, and other 
		famous and infamous outlaws all spent time in Las Vegas. A famous poster 
		from 1882 warned “Thieves, Thugs, Fakirs and Bunko-Steerers” to leave 
		town by “ten o’clock this night or you will be invited to attend a grand 
		neck-tie party, the expense of which will be borne by 100 substantial 
		citizens.”<br />
		<br />
		Harmon Houghton of Clear Light Publishers, who licensed the book to Terr 
		for audio production and distribution, says: “This was one of the first 
		books we published, and thirty years later holds the same intrigue and 
		popularity as ever. As Howard Bryan (the author) told me, Las Vegas, NM 
		made Dodge City look like a church meeting ground. I look forward to the 
		audio version as re-told by master story teller Jim Terr.” </font>&nbsp;</p>

		<font face="Calibri, serif">Imagine a town so riddled with bullet holes 
		and so full of neck&#8209;stretched hemp as to make other Wild West towns look 
		like the headquarters of a Billy Graham crusade. Las Vegas, New Mexico, 
		situated on the historic Santa Fe Trail, played host to more than its 
		share of gunfighters, bandits and Indian warriors during its heyday. As 
		an end&#8209;of&#8209;track town on the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe rail line, 
		like many railroad terminus points, it became the natural location for 
		more gun battles, barroom brawls and hangings than any other town on the 
		Western frontier.</font></p>
		<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">
		<font face="Calibri, serif">Wildest of the Wild West is not a small town 
		history, but rather a collection of Western tales relating the many 
		dramatic and melodramatic events centered around Las Vegas, New Mexico, 
		which rocked the West in the days of Billy the Kid. The Kid and Pat 
		Garrett are only two of the colorful array of characters Howard Bryan 
		presents in Wildest of the Wild West. All these true tales are drawn in 
		large part from early newspaper reports, the better to capture the 
		special style and flavor of the Old West.</font></p>
		<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">
		<font face="Calibri, serif">The years between 1835 and 1915 were indeed 
		tempestuous. Tales appearing in the book include the first hanging of a 
		woman on the Western frontier; how the daughter of an Apache chief chose 
		death over dishonor; midnight lynchings from the &quot;hanging windmill which 
		occurred to frequently that the boys of Las Vegas were hanging their 
		dogs in imitation, and the filming of some of the earliest Western 
		movies.</font></p>

		Wild west as much as thousands of people have read its pages</font></p>
