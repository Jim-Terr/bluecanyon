  <p>Hi Aurona - just a personal message. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Enjoyed talking to you, even for that brief time, about that little thing. If you're in Albuquerque, please think about coming to a performance of my character, &quot;BuDDy&quot;, Saturday January 16 at 10:30 pm (sorry!), at   &nbsp;the Tricklock Company's &quot;Reptilian Lounge&quot;, sort of a variety show. </p>
  <p>This Lounge will be at the Filling Station on 4th &amp; Pacific. . Show will start around 10:30, cost is $5. </p>
  <p>Oh, here's a sample of BuDDy: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7jvR9rVApo">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7jvR9rVApo </a></p>
  <p>Or, if you ever get to Santa Fe, my phone is 505-989-9298, and my e-mail is bluecanyon2 -AT- newmexico.com </p>
  <p>Thanks again! -Jim Terr </p>
