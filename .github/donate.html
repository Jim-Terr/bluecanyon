                HAD IT RIGHT</span></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p align="left" class="style2">
                <span class="style4">He was a funny writer, with a . . . taste
                        for pseudonymous pranks; he hid his most ascerbic opinions
                        behind the masks of made-up characters. But he had world-class
                        ambitions, and he understood that these ambitions were probably
                        best served by achievement . . . <br>
          <br>
        ...he understood that he would inevitably be viewed as a provincial, and
        that it paid to play the clown a little . . .The metropolis, while it mistrusts
        an upstart, forgives a lovable provincial eccentric. <br>
          <br>
        Franklin liked to write letters claiming to be from other people . . . in
        order to <span class="style12">dramatize some political point through obvious
        overload. </span>The
        last thing he wrote was a letter purportedly from a Muslim slaver . . . whose
        lust for slavery was intended to hold a mirror up to the American slaveholder's
        own, and shame him. <br>
          <br>
        Franklin was an instinctive ironist . . . it was his natural mode . .
        . the whole thing depended on being reported with an absolutely straight
        face. It was not that he did not value honesty . . . He would have beem
        reluctant to to say something that he believed to be a lie. But, as a
        businessman and a writer and a diplomat, he might very well be willing
        to dramatize, or even overdramatize, something he believed to be essentially
        the truth. <br>
          <br>
        Franklin's essentially ironic, distancing turn of mind . . . gave him a kind
        of second sight into the minds of his hosts. There is little sham in French
        life, but a lot of show, a lot of rhetorical gesturing. Franklin understood
        this style instantly. He was pretending to be a naif . . ., which the French
        knew to be faux, and they were pretending to be worldly, which he knew to
        be an illusion. <br>
          <br>
        But the logic of power depends largely on the perceptions, the feelings,
        of the people who have it. Franklin understood that, above all, the good
        opinion of the French mattered. It paid to be liked and admired, and he made
        sure that he was. He knew that he could not make his country, and its needs,
        inescapable if he did not make himself, and his cause, irresistable. <br>
