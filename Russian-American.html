Jim  Terr has been writing songs since at least 1972, when he was drafted into the &ldquo;Sweetgrass&rdquo;  bluegrass band in San Francisco. He is a native of Las Vegas, New Mexico, the &ldquo;original&rdquo;  Las Vegas, founded in 1835 and a very popular TV and movie location.&nbsp; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas,_New_Mexico">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas,_New_Mexico</a> <br />
<br />
By 1988, when he self-published his well-reviewed book of original song lyrics, <em>You Got to be Stupid to Sing Country  Music,</em> <em><a href="http://bluecanyonproductions.com/stupid.html">http://bluecanyonproductions.com/stupid.html</a> &nbsp;</em>and performed an original song in the  Roger Vadim remake of his 1956 Brigitte Bardot film <em>And God Created Woman,</em> <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092559/">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092559/</a> &nbsp;he was well on his way to the almost 90  song titles he had registered with BMI (the performance rights organization),  and airplay in over 25 countries, as of 2002. &nbsp;(He now estimates his songs as totaling at  least 1,000).<br />
<br />
Terr has continued to garner fans and rave reviews for his earthy-but-quirky writing  and singing style, mostly from Europe as well as from two of the most  successful US country music songwriters, <strong>Tom  T. Hall</strong> and <strong>Bobby Braddock</strong> (Braddock  is one of the most successful hit country songwriters of all time &ndash; for  every one of the past five decades!)**<br />

<br />
Well into his 60s, Terr does not aspire to be an adored stage performer, but  continues to hone his craft with one aim &ndash; writing songs for hit artists &ndash; as his  two greatest idols and admirers <strong>above </strong>have  done so consistently. Terr notes that the publishing rights on a <em>single</em> successful country song (as  opposed to the recording) can generate over a million dollars over its  lifetime, and he&rsquo;s got upwards of a hundred (10% of his  total) that he feels are of that quality. <br />
<br />
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve gotten some feedback that some of my songs are too peculiar, too  particular, too &lsquo;old style country&rsquo; for the current country market, but I think  things will get more &lsquo;traditional,&rsquo; as they have many times before in country  music.&rdquo; &nbsp;Country music is still by far  the leading single US radio format. <br />
<br />
An upcoming feature film called <em>The  Pretext ( <a href="http://www.pretextfilm.com">www.pretextfilm.com</a> ) </em>will  feature many of Terr&rsquo;s songs and performances, and other feature films  featuring his best songs are also in the works. The <em>Pretext </em>film originated as a record of Terr&rsquo;s actual run in a US  presidential primary in 2012, and evolved into a murder mystery, with satirical  references to current US president Trump. Terr&rsquo;s political satire songs have  been featured on scores of major US radio and TV networks. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
The film includes cameo appearances by <strong>several American celebrities</strong>, including Suhail Dabbach of <em>&ldquo;The Hurt Locker&rdquo;</em>, the 2008 Oscar &ldquo;Best Picture&rdquo;&nbsp; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lA1bgUYjJ0I">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lA1bgUYjJ0I</a> ,

<br />
An international investment group called The Music Investors&rsquo; Group &nbsp;<a href="http://www.MusicInvestorsGroup.com">www.MusicInvestorsGroup.com</a> &nbsp;holds much of the publishing rights to  Terr&rsquo;s original material, and after several years of behind-the-scenes  struggles (which neither Terr nor the Group has commented on), feels that the  time is right to aggressively push Terr&rsquo;s material in the US &ndash; in country music  capital Nashville in particular. The music group website has several articles  explaining the tremendous revenue streams for publishing rights to songs  recorded by major artists or used in films, TV and commercials. ( Terr is also  a recognized writer of advertising jingles, with several recognizable ones to  his credit; see <a href="http://www.TheSongwriter.us">www.TheSongwriter.us</a> ).<br />
<br />
British journalist and Nashville veteran Tony Byworth, co-editor of <em>The BILLBOARD ENCYCLOPEDIA OF COUNTRY MUSIC, </em>has followed Terr&rsquo;s career for many years and twelve self-published albums  (not counting limited-market novelty CDs). His assessment: &quot;Jim is a  prolific creator of original wit and music, with a dedicated following on the  internet, his discovery is still shamefully overlooked by the entertainment  industry.&quot;&nbsp;<br />
<em><br />
</em>Music  video venues YouTube and now Facebook have indeed been Terr&rsquo;s sweet spots, with  over 1.7 million views of his videos on YouTube and Facebook views of as many  as 142,000 (and almost 6,000 &ldquo;reposts&rdquo;) on one song, &ldquo;<em>Jimmy, Come on In,&rdquo; </em>a tribute to then-ailing President Jimmy  Carter.<br />
<br />
<strong></strong><br />
<span class="style2">History and genealogy &ndash; theater, music &amp; film:</span><br />
<strong></strong>Terr&rsquo;s  grandparents came from  <strong>Kiev,Vitebsk</strong>, <strong>Odessa</strong>, and <strong>Rostov-na-Don</strong>. Being involved in both acting and music, Terr was  startled to discover a few years ago that his great-grandfather, Jacob Terr,  was a playwright in the Yiddish theater in New York City, collaborating with  the famous <strong>Boris  Thomashefsky. ((<a href="http://www.museumoffamilyhistory.com/yt/lex/T/thomashefsky-boris.htm">http://www.museumoffamilyhistory.com/yt/lex/T/thomashefsky-boris.htm</a>&nbsp; )) He was even more surprised to find out  several years ago that he had <em>three </em>great-uncles  named Terr active in Hollywood acting and music from the 1920s through 60s. &ldquo;Clearly  it&rsquo;s in my blood,&rdquo; he says in understatement. <br />

        <p>In 1982 Terr made a <strong>goodwill  trip across the Soviet Union</strong> to take 3-D (&ldquo;stereo&rdquo; / &ldquo;View Master&rdquo;) photos  of Soviet people, to show in the USA. The project got some very high-profile  views and kudos. (<a href="http://bluecanyonproductions.com/USSR.html">http://bluecanyonproductions.com/USSR.html</a> )<br />

            <span class="style5">He recalls meeting with a large family in Tbilisi, Georgian SSR, who listened  raptly to several of his songs even though they did not understand the words. &ldquo;It  knocks here,&rdquo; one of them explained, indicating the heart, and giving Terr an  early hint that his music had some deeper communicative element. </span><br />

  &quot;Unique, talented, one-of-a-kind.&quot; <strong>-Tom T. Hall</strong></p>
        <p>&quot;Jim  Terr is a very talented singer/writer&nbsp;and I hope you enjoy his songs as  much as I do.&quot;&nbsp;<br />

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&hellip;[Jim  Terr has been] described as a modern day&nbsp;<strong>Mark Twain, Will Rogers, Jimmie Rodgers&nbsp;and&nbsp;Jackie Mason</strong>&nbsp;rolled  into one. Can I add to that list names <strong>like&nbsp;Shel  Silverstein, Tom T. Hall, Bobby Bare, Ray Stevens</strong>&nbsp;and the likes-- master  wordsmiths all, and country boys too&hellip; &nbsp;&nbsp; -<strong>Brian Ahern</strong>,&nbsp;Country Music &amp; More (UK)&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &quot;Bodacious&quot;&nbsp;-<strong>Dave Barry</strong></p>
        <p>&quot;Wise,  witty and whimsical (and sometimes sad)&quot;&nbsp;-<strong>Tony Hillerman</strong></p>
        <p>&quot;Some  of&nbsp;the&nbsp;most thoroughly enjoyable&nbsp;tunes&nbsp;I've ever  heard...tiny monuments to songwriting...For whatever elements came together to  make the genius of Jim Terr and his music happen, we should be truly gleeful,  grateful and gratified&hellip;.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;He shares equal territory with the folksy  politicism of&nbsp;<strong>Phil Ochs</strong>, the  sheer songwriting skill of&nbsp;<strong>Townes  van Zandt</strong>, and the shamelessly naive sense of ironic humor of&nbsp;<strong>Loudon Wainwright III</strong>.&quot;&nbsp;<br />

        <p><strong>Jim Marshall, British  Country Music Bulletin</strong>:<br />
  &nbsp;  &nbsp; An entertaining, description-defying collection... If one were to invite  comparisons, you'd perhaps liken Jim Terr to&nbsp;<strong>Tom T. Hall</strong>, or, perhaps&nbsp;<strong>Paul  Craft.</strong></p>
        <p>&quot;A  highly creative, satirical Outlander and asskicking comedian without  parallel;&nbsp;an excellent writer...reminds me of&nbsp;<strong>Calvin Trillin&hellip; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Mike Mallo</strong>y</p>
        <p>&quot;Jim  Terr's spirit shows through consistently in his songs... It's the droll,  sardonic,&nbsp;'cut-the-B.S.' outlook known around the world as  American.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>-James  Fallows</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&quot;Jim  Terr&rsquo;s creativity and versatility are unmatched.&nbsp; Well,&nbsp;almost&nbsp;unmatched.&quot;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;-<strong>Hodding Carter III&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>&quot;One  of the true creative geniuses of our time. .This guy does some of the best  satire in the business. One of the great comedic and auditory geniuses of our  day.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
