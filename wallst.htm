          Ivanka Trump -- the Donald's daughter -- is actually quite impressive. 
          In one vignette, she explains how her father pointed to a beggar at 
          the step of the Trump Tower and said, "That man is 8 million dollars 
          richer than we are." Given the extraordinary debts that the senior Trump 
          was experiencing at the time, the statement had some validity. Ivanka 
          explains that this was a moment that drew her closer to her father and 
          encouraged her to follow in his footsteps.&quot;</font><a href="http://www.liberatedminds.org">
