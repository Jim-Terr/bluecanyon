        <p><strong><br />
          Little-known &ldquo;film town&rdquo; may spawn  Iraqi-American film alliance<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>(December 14, 2014)<br />
  <br />
  <img src="/images/Suhail49b-309.12.jpg" width="200" height="161" />  <strong>&nbsp;</strong>Suhail Aldabbach<strong><br />
  <br />
    Suhail Aldabbach </strong>was seen regularly on TV and in films in the Arab  world, and made a indelible impression on international audiences when the film  in which he had a riveting, startling scene, <strong>THE HURT LOCKER</strong>, won the &ldquo;Best Picture&rdquo; Oscar for 2010. Aldabbach  played &ldquo;Black Suit Man,&rdquo; a reluctant suicide bomber desperate to be disarmed,  in a largely improvised, heartbreaking scene which few who saw the film will  ever forget.<br />
  <br />
          But the Iraqi actor and his wife and four children were already en route to the  USA to make a new life, and recently became US citizens. Aldabbach has had a  few film roles since moving to New Mexico, but has made his living as a cook,  and expresses no resentment about his lost &ldquo;status&rdquo; as a film actor. <br />
  <br />
  <em>See article: <strong>&ldquo;War zone to Albuquerque: Seeking a normal Life&rdquo;</strong> </em><a href="http://www.abqjournal.com/143744/upfront/war-zone-to-albuquerque.html"><em>http://www.abqjournal.com/143744/upfront/war-zone-to-albuquerque.html</em></a><br />
  <br />
          But Aldabbach&rsquo;s cameo roles in a few prospective feature films in development  by New Mexico writer/producer Jim Terr, may re-launch his acting career in a  new direction. He has a key role in one almost-completed feature film, <strong>&ldquo;A  Chicken in Every Garage</strong>&rdquo;, a mystery/comedy based on Terr&rsquo;s run in the 2012 US  presidential primary in Arizona. <br />
  <br />
          The film also features cameos from such celebrities as humorist <strong>Dave Barry</strong>, National Public Radio host <strong>Scott Simon</strong>, author and &ldquo;outed&rdquo; US spy <strong>Valerie Plame Wilson</strong>, journalist <strong>James Fallows</strong>, &ldquo;Firesign Theater&rdquo;  veteran <strong>Philip Proctor</strong> and others. Terr  lives and produces in the small town of Las Vegas, New Mexico, which ironically  has been the location for hundreds of feature films, including &ldquo;Red Dawn&rdquo; and  Oscar winner <strong>&ldquo;No Country for Old Men.&rdquo;</strong><br />
  <br />
  <em>See  Wikipedia: </em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas,_New_Mexico#Films"><em>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas,_New_Mexico#Films</em></a><br />
  <br />
          Terr is both a feature film and documentary producer, with over one million  views of his videos on YouTube.com. He is also an accomplished and  well-recognized singer/songwriter, who has had original songs in other feature  films, and nationally broadcast advertising jingles. He is also an actor, with  a role most recently in the 2012 Dutch film, &ldquo;Jackie&rdquo;, starring Oscar winner <strong>Holly Hunter</strong>. <br />
  <br />
          Although Terr says he &ldquo;will always be a low-budget or at least economical  producer,&rdquo; he has gotten investment in a couple of the current projects from  some significant media figures, and hopes to form a consortium with some Middle  Eastern investors or media companies who understand his direction and intentions  for &ldquo;bridging cultures&rdquo; with the films. <br />
