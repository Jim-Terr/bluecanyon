        <p align="left" class="style7"><strong>Clara McSweeney</strong> is one of the <em>grande dames</em> of Santa  Fe society, active in philanthropy, art and liberal politics, but with a  cynical eye which has only sharpened as her 80 years get closer to 90.  Basically, she plays the game in order to have something to do, but thinks it&rsquo;s  all bullshit.</p>
        <p align="left" class="style7">She announces to her housekeeper, <strong>Roselda</strong>, who&rsquo;s half her age but much more conservative and  conventional, that they&rsquo;ll be taking in her nephew, <strong>Rodney Workman</strong>, an Outsider Artist from rural Virginia, whose  mother (Clara&rsquo;s estranged sister), has died, leaving Rodney with no one to care  for him.</p>
        <p align="left" class="style7">Roselda is ruffled, but makes preparations for putting  Rodney and his studio in the guest house.</p>
        <p align="left" class="style7">Rodney arrives by private jet (arranged by Clara), with the  pilot, co-pilot and stewardess so charmed they barely want to let him go. Wild  happenings on the plane ride are hinted at, but left unclear.</p>
        <p align="left" class="style7">Unlike Roselda, Aunt Clara is very much at ease with Rodney,  being a bit of an eccentric herself, but even she is thrown off a bit by some  of Rodney&rsquo;s wilder behavior, statements, and his art.</p>
        <p align="left" class="style7">His art is in an <em>animals-as-sexy-humans </em>phase, such as upright horses dancing and bears cruising each other at the  bar, some of the assorted males &ldquo;erect.&rdquo;</p>
        <p align="left" class="style7">The bulk of the set-up consists of Rodney mostly clashing  with and befuddling the local art and high-society &ldquo;establishment&rdquo; whom Clara  tries to introduce him to, with a series of parties, receptions and other  outings. Part of the &ldquo;arc&rdquo; is that Clara discovers and acknowledges that she&rsquo;s  really not so much a part of this crowd herself. </p>
        <p align="left" class="style7">A bar-hopping outing and meeting with prominent local  journalist and art critic, <strong>Matt  Stoneridge</strong>, arranged by Clara, starts well with country dancing and some  clumsy courting, but goes disastrously wrong, resulting in bad vibes for all  concerned, and reduced prospects for local publicity and success for Rodney.</p>
        <p align="left" class="style7">Rodney meets a young woman, <strong>Petra</strong>, a schoolteacher, open enough to be very at ease with him,  and she brings him by her school art class. Of course Rodney and the students  hit it off &ndash; except for a kid or two who are uptight, much like Clara&rsquo;s housekeeper,  Roselda. The work that Rodney and the kids are doing together (with an enforced  de-emphasis on naked, sexy animals) becomes a big hit and a big fundraising  vehicle for the school. Rodney is getting locally famous by following his own  path.</p>
        <p align="left" class="style7">Enter <strong>Cerise</strong>, a  beautiful party girl and hustler who snuggles up next to Rodney, but whom we  suspect is only in it for the novelty and money.&nbsp; But circumstances (particularly with the  kids) test her patience, and she&rsquo;s embarrassed into revealing that he &ldquo;love&rdquo; for  Rodney was insincere, and very temporary. But not before an unsuccessful  attempt by Cerise and art critic Stoneridge to scandalize both Rodney and  Clara.</p>
        <p align="left" class="style7">Rodney has found his home in Santa Fe among the kids, his  aunt, and his reinstated friend (if not girlfriend), Petra. A smaller but more  intimate &ldquo;social circle&rdquo; that everyone was, in their hearts, aiming for.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ndash;END-</p>

        <p>Junebug was a hit, a lot of people liked the artist, so one could say there's some amount of box office out there. I think they liked the character because he was a true believer, pretty unique but still there was something kinda renegade you could connect to. Not unlike Rain Man, Chauncy Gardener in Being There, and some idiot savant characters we might have come across. But the true believer quality I think resonates the most.</p>
        <p> It seems important to transplant him whole into another story, same accent and mannerisms, except we could not get away with his true beliefs manifested in the Civil War and biblical lore a la Junebug which of course is why you came up with the humans as sexy animals genre (can he believe as strongly there?). If, let's say, his trip to Santa Fe was like Chauncy walking out into the world for the first time, it seems like he would be strongly affected by what he sees there and who he meets. Totally different terrain, light, and perhaps he wanders into the Navaho culture also.<br />
          <br />
          Being There was a parody in part I think about our government leaders who mistook anything that Chauncy said as prophecy when we knew otherwise but at the end of the movie we see him walk on water, cool.<br />
          <br />
          I wonder what Junebug would have been like had it been more about the artist. If we like him for his innocence would we want to protect him from the Santa Fe art scene that his aunt Claire thinks is bullshit? I see the appeal of his working with children.<br />
          Does his presence in the story make any difference in the life of others or even his own? Outsider artists also seem to be outsider human beings but hell I guess you could say that about any artist......<br />
          <br />
          some thoughts Jim.......call me or email whenever......best, Frank</p>
