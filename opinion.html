    <font size="3">By Jim Terr </font></font></font></P>
  <P ALIGN="left"><FONT SIZE="+1"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There 
    is only so much I can absorb about crime, education, Social Security, guns, 
    abortion and school vouchers, especially when the candidates' positions often 
    seem to reflect polling and focus group data more than personal passion and 
    original thinking. And how much of what's said on the campaign trail will 
    really be translated into policy, anyway? I've often toyed with what questions 
    I would ask candidates for national office if I could sit down with them and 
    really get them to answer. (And in fact I do have a rather risky and expensive 
    scheme to actually address some jarring questions to the candidates.) </font></FONT></P>
  <P ALIGN="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Some of the 
    following questions are intended to help me probe the candidates' values, 
    priorities, introspectiveness and candor, some to bring attention to issues 
    not being addressed, and some just to see if they know what I'm talking about:</font></P>
  <P ALIGN="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Are you 
    concerned that the average American CEO now makes 475 times what the average 
    worker makes (10 times the 1980 figure), while doing all he can to minimize 
    wages and benefits and send jobs overseas if possible? Is there any behavior 
    or level of personal wealth that you would define as greed? Do you believe 
    most Americans are better off economically than they were 20 years ago? </font></P>
  <P ALIGN="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What do you 
    think about the strictures on social behavior and public policy necessitated 
    by our litigious society? What are your thoughts on the bureaucratic and corporate 
    mindset that seems to negate employees' creative, spontaneous, intuitive and 
    generous instincts? How do you feel about "instant" Internet voting? </font></P>
  <P ALIGN="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">How many 
    people starve to death in the world each day? When was the last time you addressed 
    this in a speech or interview? How much death, illness, oppression and other 
    misery is caused worldwide by US government and corporate policy, in your 
    estimation? </font></P>
  <P ALIGN="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Do you feel 
    that Americans care about and depend upon the welfare of others in the world? 
    Do you think the American people would appreciate your leaving a legacy of 
    environmental, economic and social justice, world peace, democracy, and a 
    worldwide living wage? Do you think that such a focus would provide maximum 
    security for Americans as well? </font></P>
  <P ALIGN="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Do you think 
    that the interests of "Wall Street" are inherently different from those of 
    "Main Street", and that the current system of campaign finance and "soft money" 
    tilts the balance of influence to corporate interests at the expense of citizens? 
    </font></P>
  <P ALIGN="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Are you concerned 
    about the fear-and-misinformation industry, phony corporate and advocacy front 
    groups, and the politicization of health, nutrition and consumer information? 
    Do you think of federal lands as being owned by the government or by the public?</font></P>
  <P ALIGN="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">How do you 
    feel about radar detectors? Taxing Internet sales? Universal health care? 
    Have you ever been attracted to someone of the same sex, even momentarily 
    or mistakenly? Do you think marijuana causes more havoc than alcohol? Do you 
    think global warming is a fiction? Do you feel that most gun control advocates 
    are really bent on elimination of private gun ownership? </font></P>
  <P ALIGN="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When did 
    you last listen to "Prairie Home Companion?" How about "Click and Clack, the 
    Tappet Brothers"? Are you concerned about the growing proportion of business 
    and financial news on PBS-TV and National Public Radio, relative to the truly 
    alternative political, economic and environmental content that characterized 
    their founding? </font></P>
  <P ALIGN="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Are you aware 
    of the rapid reduction and pollution of water supplies and water tables, including 
    in the US? When was the last time you expressed concern about this in a speech 
    or interview? Does your family have a private source of water that does not 
    depend on the same water supplies as the rest of us? </font></P>
  <P ALIGN="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">How do you 
    feel about Tacitus' statement that "The more numerous the laws, the more corrupt 
    the state"? Do you have any ideas on reducing the body of law to a level such 
    that the average citizen can get through life on her best civic and social 
    instincts, without retaining an attorney? How do you feel about Mark Twain's 
    statement that "It's getting harder and harder to assemble a jury, because 
    it's getting so hard to find 12 people who don't know anything and can't read"? 
    How about Thomas Jefferson's warning that corporations should be strictly 
    limited in their size, power and duration, and should never be accorded the 
    rights of citizens? </font></P>
  <P ALIGN="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Do you feel 
    that TV and movie violence encourages violent behavior? Do you think that 
    excessive TV and video games are reducing children's ability to think, read 
    and socialize? If so, when was the last time you addressed this in a speech 
    or interview?</font></P>
  <P ALIGN="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In matters 
    such as honesty, trust, civility, Constitutional and historical knowledge, 
    littering, voting, debate, handicapped parking and running stop signs, do 
    you think the average person is getting more--or less--civic-minded? </font></P>
  <P ALIGN="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Would you 
    desire a different punishment for someone who robbed your mother of her life 
    savings, depending on whether they stole it physically or "with a fountain 
    pen?" </font></P>
  <P ALIGN="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What do you 
    think of the idea of having the prosecution and defense decide and declare 
    before a verdict is delivered, whether the trial was fair and proper, rather 
    than automatically requesting an appeal or mistrial if the verdict doesn't 
    go their way? </font></P>
  <P ALIGN="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Well, now 
    that that's over, let's go to Starbucks to discuss the decline of local businesses 
    at the expense of national and multi-national chains. I'll buy! </font></P>

          <font size="3">by Rep. Peter DeFazio</font> <br>
          (reprinted by permission)</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> <i><font size="3">Think 
          the days of thousand-dollar hammers and screwdrivers and bolts are gone? 
          Wrong. The Pentagon loses ships: they do not know where they are.... 
          The Pentagon cannot even have their books audited to figure out how 
          they are spending their money, yet we are giving them more money. (Republican 
          Budget Committee chairman, John Kasich, on the House floor, March 23, 
          2000)</font></i></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> We 
          recently saw Congress's response to the growing crisis in waste and 
          inefficiency at the Pentagon. The House overwhelmingly authorized a 
          record $309.9 billion for the Defense Department, $4.5 billion over 
          the President's request and an increase of $21.1 billion from last year. 
          Pathetically, an amendment to put some pressure on the Pentagon brass 
          to reign in waste with a 1percent reduction in procurement and research 
          and development was rejected 331 to 88. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">President 
          Clinton bears much of the responsibility for the run up in Pentagon 
          spending. He has recommended increases in Pentagon spending in 6of his 
          8 budget proposals. However, in an effort not to be outdone by thePresident 
          they call a "draft dodger," the Republican majority, since taking over 
          Congress in 1994, has trumped his requests with another $41.8 billion 
          in unrequested increases. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Kasich 
          justifies the increases despite his devastating criticism of waste at 
          the Pentagon by saying: "We do not want our people in uniform to pay 
          the price for sloppy management inside the Pentagon." </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Unfortunately, 
          it is the men and women in the ranks who are suffering along with millions 
          of average Americans who have seen vital programs and benefits cut to 
          finance Pentagon waste. More than 16,000 enlisted families still qualify 
          for food stamps. I met the father of a Marine shopping for a waterproof 
          bag for his son's fancy digital field radio--the Pentagon could only 
          afford a garbage bag. Officers during the Gulf War called home to ask 
          their families to buy hand-held Global Positioning Satellite units the 
          Pentagon couldn't provide.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> It 
          is the same old "Iron Triangle" President Eisenhower warned us about, 
          back with a vengeance forty years later. Newt Gingrich forced the purchase 
          of unneeded C-130s to benefit his District. Trent Lott has forced the 
          building of an unrequested air craft carrier to benefit a shipyard in 
          his home state. Despite $50 billion spent without a single successful 
          honest test, Ronald Reagan's Star Wars fantasy is being pushed toward 
          deployment, jeopardizing the ABM and START treaties. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Recently, 
          a report leaked from a special panel of defense-contractor executives 
          established by the Pentagon to study problems with their industry. "Industry 
          management and government share responsibility for the problem. Fixing 
          these problems is critical to our future national security." Unfortunately, 
          this is not an enlightened report about the waste and inefficiency in 
          procurement. It is a report bemoaning the low stock prices and lack 
          of profitability for defense contractors. Among the solutions: Pay contractors 
          to merge, downsize and lay off workers and reward executives, boards 
          of directors and stockholders for these efforts; cut "barriers" to sophisticated 
          arms exports; rein in whistle blowers, and raise profit levels. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">George 
          W. Bush is alarmed about our "hollow military," promising large increases 
          in spending for the Pentagon, and Al Gore is following in Clinton's 
          footsteps on this issue. Congress has given up any pretense of wanting 
          any restraint at the Pentagon. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">During 
          budget deliberations earlier this year, as Chair of the Congressional 
          Progressive Caucus (CPC), I offered an alternative federal budget proposal 
          that made prudent reductions in military spending totalling $30 billion 
          in order to more adequately fund education, health care, housing, infrastructure 
          repair and veterans' and seniors' programs, among other priorities. 
          Many of the reductions were based on the work of Larry Korb, Assistant 
          Secretary of Defense under Ronald Reagan, who has calculated a strong 
          national defense should only cost around $225 billion a year. The CPC 
          budget won only 61 votes.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Looks 
          like we'll be waiting a few more years for the post-cold war "peace 
          dividend." </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>(Peter 
          DeFazio represents Oregon's 4th Congressional District). We are honored 
          to have distributed this essay to 113 "alternative weekly" newspapers

            MY FAITH</b> <br>
            by Jim Terr <br>
          </p>
        </div>
        <p align="center"><i>(continued from Home page)</i></p>
        <p>I am not gauging this by my own microscopic understanding of physics, 
          biology, organic chemistry, etc., but rather by the comprehension exhibited 
          by the wisest people in all such fields. To the best of my knowledge, 
          most of them profess progressively greater wonder at the mystery and 
          Grand Design of life, the deeper they dig and the more they understand.</p>
        <p>The example that always comes to mind is the struggle of scientists 
          to create in the laboratory simple proteins, the simplest building blocks 
          of all organisms. </p>
        <p>Forget about skin, circulatory systems, digestive systems, nervous 
          systems thousands of times more complex and subtle than the most sophisticated 
          computer. Forget about the ability to think, to grow, reproduce, fight 
          disease, sleep and heal. Just creating a basic unit of protein has proven 
          almost impossible to the most skilled and well-equipped scientists.</p>
        <p>And I have no problem accepting the existence of a higher being, a 
          higher intelligence, a vaster design. Why should I? Does accepting this 
          diminish my own experience of joy, of power, of opportunity? Am I, as 
          a person, any less wondrous than an ocean, a river, a cloudy sky or 
          the infinite heavens? I certainly don’t feel so; in fact, I feel in 
          awe of all of them, not to mention my own body.</p>
        <p>Fortunately, I wasn’t raised with any exaggerated notion of human grandeur, 
          independence or supremacy, of Man’s dominion over nature. I think that 
          the conscious or unconscious assumption of my parents, and of the immediate 
          culture in which I was raised, was that people are a wondrous cog in 
          a wondrous system called Life and Nature, here to enjoy that system 
          while we can. So the idea of God or of a higher intelligence behind 
          that system is perfectly acceptable, and in no way demeans my own feelings 
          of self-esteem.</p>
        <p>Neither do I feel that my belief in God or a higher intelligence is 
          simply a wishful adult projection of the childlike state of dependency 
          on a father figure. It simply seems obvious and natural, or at least 
          convenient, to posit and believe in a higher power. </p>
        <p>As I am more powerful and comprehending than a baby, and a baby presumably 
          more powerful and complex than a twig, so do I think it likely that 
          there is a much more complex system and a more powerful consciousness 
          of which I am a part, and it feels quite natural to think so. And if 
          there is a higher consciousness, why can I not tap into it--and sometimes 
          even get a response to a request--by prayer and mediation? In fact, 
          I often do. Somehow I’ve never had the impression of the lines of communication 
          being jammed or clogged at any given moment. </p>
        <p>As a final note, I was raised a Jew in small Christian communities, 
          in the 1950s and 1960s, before the concept of the separation of church 
          and state was extended to mean no religious expression for anyone in 
          the public sphere. I loved singing Christmas carols, I loved exchanging 
          gifts at Christmas (of course), and my later appreciation of my own 
          religious heritage was in no way stunted or diluted. I thank God that 
          no one was watching out for my right to avoid all religions at that 
          time. </p>
