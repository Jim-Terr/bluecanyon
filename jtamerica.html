                    and ethnic origin is unknown. But of course we in Arizona
                    don’t care about that. We care about a person’s inner worth,
                    their willingness to play hard and work by the rules. I mean
                    work hard and play by the rules. Inner worth, I’ve got a lot

                    with a few cactus and a few so-called Native Americans. They
                    built this up to the thriving, sprawling water-sucking
                    paradise that it is today, where people of all kinds live
                    together in peace and harmony. </p>
                  <p align="left">I have that same vision for America. Won’t you
                    join me? This is a people’s campaign. In fact I don’t even
                    want to run. But people from all over America said “Mitt,
                    will you run?” (Somehow his e-mail account was diverted to
                    mine for about 36 hours, but it got me to thinking…)<br />
                    <br />
                    Of course I should run. America needs me. I’ve got nothing
                    better to do between now and November. Maybe I’ll win. I
                    know I can count on the support of the little people. In
                    fact, I’m not going to accept contributions of anything
                    greater than $25,000 per individual or family or
                    corporation. Actual campaign contribution limits may even
                    smaller than that. So you see, this is about you, about
                    taking America back.</p>
                  <p align="left">Back from the Obamas, from the Lockheeds, from
                    the Wall Streets, from the Bushes, the Rockefellers, the
                    Illuminati and the Bilderbergs. Let’s return it to the
                    Garcias, the Terrs, the Joneses. (Are there any Joneses
                    anymore?) The Washingtons, the Lincolns, the Jeffersons.
                    Where ARE the Washingtons, the Lincolns, the Jeffersons,
                    today? I’ll tell you where, they’re all playing professional
                    basketball. That’s an old joke I’ve always loved. <br />
                    <br />
                    This campaign isn’t about being politically correct, so
                    you’d better get used to it. It’s not about appealing to the
                    most far-right, ignorant, fundamentalist xenophobes in Iowa,
                    in order to win a caucus and show how far-right, ignorant,
                    fundamentalist and xenophobic I am. It’s about appealing to
                    the most far-right, ignorant, fundamentalist xenophobes in
                    the great state of Arizona, because I know we represent the
                    best America has to offer; we embody a vision of what
                    America can be again. <br />
                    <br />
                    Those who say America was never meant to be a Christian
                    country, I say let them prove it. Where are the documents?
                    Where is the birth certificate of this so-called Thomas
                    Jefferson, this so-called George Washington? I think a lot
                    of Americans need to just shut up and let nature take its
                    course. Let me run this place. <em>Give Jim Terr a chance
                      to steal from you! </em></p>
                  <p align="left">If nominated I will not run, and if elected I
                    will not serve. That is my solemn promise to you. I will
                    issue shriveling indictments of any candidate or incumbent –
                    for any office – who does not reject and eschew our current
                    rotten system of private – and now, <em>unlimited and
                      secret</em> corporate – contributions to election
                    campaigns. I could make many more specific promises but we
                    all know they are forgotten when you get in that
                    presidential hot seat, so who are we kidding? I promise to
                    do my best, and consult with my trusted circle of Wall
                    Street advisers at every critical juncture. </p>
                  <p align="left">In the coming weeks I’ll be sharing more about
                    myself, and my vision of an America returned to its rightful
                    owners. The corporations. That’s who knows how to run
                    America like a business. Which is what our Founders
                    intended. Of <u>course</u> corporations are human. It’s <em>people</em>
                    I wonder about. </p>
                  <p align="left">Together, we can work together for a better
                    America. At least for me. Won’t you join me? Together we can
                    take America back. Way back. God bless us all in this mighty
                    endeavor.  </p>

                  <strong>Santa Fe</strong><strong> Entertainer Backs Campaign
                    With Film Project</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Jim Terr</strong> – arguably New Mexico’s best kept
                  secret – is not a person to be deterred by lack of attention
                  from the entertainment industry. Instead, and backed with
                  self-perpetuated shameless publicity, he moves from one
                  project to another.</p>
                <p>Boasting over 700,000 views to more than 400 videos on his
                  YouTube channel (HYMIEHYMIE) and some 70,000 Google citations,
                  alongside appearances on a multitude of national TV and radio
                  outlets, the Santa Fe based entertainer is nothing less than
                  one-man industry.</p>
                <p>Perhaps best known as a singer/songwriter, he also stacks up
                  credits as record producer, filmmaker, actor (recently filmed
                  in the Dutch independent production <strong>“<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2108546/">Jackie</a>”</strong>
                  starring <strong>Holly Hunter</strong>), political satirist
                  and bona fide US presidential candidate in the Arizona
                  primary, February 28, drawing #2 spot on the ballot, ahead of
                  Newt Gingrich, Mitt Romney, Ron Paul and the other nominees (<a
                    href="http://www.JTAmerica.com">www.JTAmerica.com</a>).</p>
                <p>Since videotaping his experiences on campaign trail, and
                  writing songs as always, Terr decided to combine all these
                  interests and opportunities into a feature film about a
                  singer/songwriter kidnapped on a USO tour in the Mid-East,
                  hypnotized by a mysterious organization to carry out a
                  "Manchurian Candidate" style mission, then returned to his
                  normal routine of music and politics - and a political
                  campaign - while waiting for the trap to be released.</p>
                <p>Co-star is <strong>Suhail Aldabbach</strong>, remembered for
                  his memorable role as the remorseful suicide bomber in the
                  2010 Oscar "Best Picture" <strong>“The Hurt Locker”</strong>.
                  He is now a (refugee) resident of New Mexico, and he and Terr
                  have teamed up on several prospective feature projects.
                  Aldabbach is set to have a featured role in Oscar winning
                  director <strong>Kathryn Bigelow</strong>'s next project –
                  the yet to be named account of the hunt for Osama Bin Laden –
                  so he will have an even higher profile soon.</p>
                <p>Also having a key role in the Terr project is rotund country
                  singer <strong>BuDDy</strong>, with cameo appearances by
                  humorist <strong>Dave Barry</strong>, journalist <strong>James
                    Fallows</strong>, NPR host <strong>Scott Simon</strong>, <strong>"Firesign
                    Theater"</strong> co-founder <strong>Phil Proctor</strong>
                  and others. Intended as a very low-budget production most
                  likely destined to go directly to DVD and download, <strong>Jim
                    Terr</strong> (in common with so many prospective
                  independent film producers) is currently seeking out
                  interested investors. He hopes that with the frustration of
                  the political season, this coming summer, the intended summer
                  release, and a compelling plot, and lots of music and good
                  soundtrack CD, will make the project a success.</p>
                <p>A trailer for the film can be seen on YouTube (“Reluctant

                  Las Vegas, New Mexico—<strong>Jan. 22, 2012</strong>—During a
                  press conference outside his home on Sunday,  Jim Terr,
                  Republican hopeful for president in the Arizona Presidential
                  Preference Election February 28, shared his reactions to South

                  <br />
                  Terr commented, “Was there any suprise here? The guy with the

                  President Obama in the general election, won. He successfully

                  about his undisclosed tax returns -- which he was. <em>Oops,

                  to hammer him with it in a couple months. On the question of
                  his disgusting behavior in both his personal life and his
                  political life, well, Evangelicals love a supposedly reformed
                  sinner. Especially when he provides a stirringly righteous
                  offensive defense, making himself look like a victim of the
                  so-called liberal media.”<br />
                  <br />
                  As to Ron Paul and Rick Santorum, who Terr says “Say what they
                  think and are evidently unwilling to prostitute themselves to
                  suit the rabidly anti-Obama, moralistic, right-wing electorate
                  of South Carolina, they, unsurprisingly, didn’t do so well.”
                  Terr added, “I have been a proud member of the Republican
                  party, the party of my father (blessed be his memory) and a
                  couple other people I know and like regardless, for 17 days,
                  and it has been a thrilling ride. It has forced me to
                  contemplate The Mind of the Republican, and to consider what
                  it would take to bring us proud, lifelong Republicans back to
                  the mainstream of American society.”<br />
                  <br />
                  Terr, who drew the number two position on the Arizona GOP
                  ballot, stated, “In my campaign I shall endeavor to combine
                  the best of the ideas put forth by the other GOP candidates
                  (well, Ron Paul had a good one on cutting back on US military
                  adventures and Empire; I can’t think of any others right now),
                  along with my own fanciful notions about Public Campaign
                  Finance, repealing Citizens’ United, and nominating Supreme
                  Court justices who are not ideologues and Tools of Industry,
                  into a broadly appealing campaign.”<br />
                  <br />
                  ”I also affirm my core campaign promise that if nominated I
                  will not run, and if I am elected I will not serve,” Terr
                  added emphatically. “I love that Arizona gives us lesser-known
                  candidates a chance to make our voices heard here before the
                  national liberal news media.”<br />
                  <br />
                  Terr refrained from making comments on his “alternative
                  candidate” competitors on the Arizona ballot, though he says
                  he has a “thick and incriminating dossier” on each. “I prefer
                  to run a positive campaign,” Terr stated.<br />
