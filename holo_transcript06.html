                  this subject, and 20% of the American people seem to agree with 
                  the Holocaust deny us. Twenty percent is an enormous amount. 
                  We have to try what we can to, not only prove them wrong, but 
                  to prove that there is a malicious intent on their part to do 
                  that&#133;..OK, I'm ready whenever you are&#133;.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I'll start 
                  with where I come from, and then go on from there. Is it OK 
                  for me to occasionally look into here, or, as I say, 90% I know 
                  it by heart, but I don't want to jump. I want to stay with the 
                  story and not to jump the subjects.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">My name 
                  is Aron Straser. I was born in Poland, in a shtetl or a village 
                  not far in the northeastern part of Poland, about 150 kilometers 
                  from the Russian border. We lived there, my family and I, which 
                  consisted of my mother, father, brother and sister--peacefully, 
                  I would say. Although Poland had the largest Jewish population 
                  of any European country--over 3 million people. I consider now 
                  that the Jews of Poland were treated as secondhand citizens. 
                  In other words, we had our limitations, but just the same, we 
                  were not faced with a life-threatening situation. In 1941, as 
                  you know, Stalin and Hitler signed a pact to divide and occupy 
                  Poland. On June 22, 1941, the Germans began their&#133;Oh, I'm 
                  sorry, I have to go back&#133;..In 1939, the Russian&#133;..I'll 
                  just retract a little bit. &#133;.In 1939, Stalin, the Russian 
                  leader, and, of course, Hitler, signed a pact to divide and 
                  occupy Poland. Since we were in the northeastern part of Poland, 
                  we fell under the Russian occupation. Briefly, things have changed 
                  for the Jewish people, in respect that a lot of the properties 
                  of the businesspeople were liquidated, but the ordinary worker 
                  didn't face much of a change. I had to attend the Russian school, 
                  and learn the language. There was no freedom in Russia at that 
                  time, but as I said earlier, our lives were not threatened, 
                  until June of 1941, when the Germans attacked the Russian forces, 
                  and in a week they had reached our area. We already knew what 
                  to expect from the Germans. I recall in the beginning of 1941, 
                  some Jewish refugees from Germany ended up in our area, and 
                  from them we learned these unbelievable stories of atrocities 
                  that they were exposed to in Germany. Their properties were 
                  confiscated; they could not work at their professions; they 
                  had to wear a yellow Star of David on their outer clothing; 
                  they could not walk on the sidewalk, only on the streets; they 
                  were finally ordered to turn in all of their valuables under 
                  the threat of prison. Then they were taken to the Polish border 
                  and forced under the threat of a machine gun, to cross into 
                  Poland. They tried to reach Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia, 
                  and from there, perhaps escape to the west. But I don't think 
                  any of them had a chance to make it.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The day 
                  after the Germans attacked the Russian forces; we found one 
                  couple who happened to be employed by our village as teachers. 
                  We found them in a water well. And that's when we realized that 
                  the stories we heard that we thought perhaps were exaggerated, 
                  were not exaggerated at all. This particular couple could not 
                  face the Nazis anymore, and they committed suicide. Knowing 
                  what to expect from the Germans, the question is what could 
                  the Jews of Poland do? Three million people-where could they 
                  run to? Really, Poland is a land-locked country. To the south 
                  of Poland is Czechoslovakia, which was already overrun by the 
                  Germans. And, of course, to the east was Russia. So, my family 
                  and I started to run toward the Russian border on foot. The 
                  question was, to which border, of course. The only border we 
                  could reach was the Russian border, hoping that they would let 
                  us cross into Russia, and from there, perhaps escape the Germans. 
                  But this was wishful thinking on our part. We reached the border 
                  in three days. Once we were there, we were told that since we 
                  were not citizens of Russian, we would not be allowed to cross 
                  into Russia. We waited there for a few days, hoping, perhaps 
                  they would change their minds. I would estimate there were about 
                  500-600 people that tried to do the same as we planned.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We reached 
                  a little village called Haraodok which was a few miles from 
                  the border. Soon, we heard that the Germans were coming and 
                  that they were coming from the east. They occupied Minsk, which 
                  was the capital city of White Russia. And I-not only I-many 
                  of us were puzzled. How is it possible when Germany was to the 
                  west of us? What happened is that they had conquered a huge 
                  area to the south and north in White Russia, and they were just 
                  mopping up the area. They rounded up several hundred thousand 
                  Russian prisoners of war. So here we are, facing the Germans, 
                  and I'll never forget the impression it made on me. The powerful 
                  German military, compared to the Polish Army, it was like a 
                  David and Goliath comparison. As I was watching them passing 
                  by-of course, the ground was shaking from the weight of the 
                  tanks--I was just thinking to myself, how can an army like that 
                  be defeated. Which means, what does the future hold for us. 
                  Not only uncertain, but probably pain, misery, and we couldn't 
                  think of being liberated. Anyway, we didn't really have much 
                  time to think about it. All of a sudden, the Germans on those 
                  motorcycles showed up with a Polish police interpreter. They 
                  told all of the Jews that were gathered there to go to the city 
                  square. They separated the men from the women. Our brothers 
                  and sisters were about a hundred feet away, maybe two hundred. 
                  And the men from the age of 15 and older were told to kneel 
                  on the ground with our hands above our heads and simply wait. 
                  We were surrounded by the Germans, with their machine guns pointed 
                  at us. We could hear the women crying from far away, because 
                  we weren't sure what the Germans had in mind. We thought, perhaps, 
                  that they may liquidate us right there and then. But evidently 
                  they didn't have the orders to do that. After about 2 hours 
                  sitting on the ground, they told us to get up, join our womenfolks, 
                  and go back to where we came from, in order to qualify for food 
                  rationing cards. Of course, without those cards, food was not 
                  available. You couldn't buy it. Needless to say, we rounded 
                  up our belongings and started on foot to go back to the village 
                  of Smorgonie, where we came from.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When we 
                  returned to our village, we found that our homes were burned 
                  out. We stayed with friends whose house was still standing. 
                  About a week later, we were told that all the Jews had to report 
                  to a ghetto.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>
                  Wherever the Jews lived in Poland-whether in a small village 
                  or a large city like Warsaw of the city of large (?)-The Jews 
                  were separated from the other groups and put into a ghetto. 
                  Now a ghetto you may think is a place where a certain ethnic 
                  group is residing, like perhaps the ghetto of Holland. That's 
                  not what the Germans had in mind for the Jews. They would usually 
                  pick Islam area, and encircle the area with a barbed wire fence, 
                  with one main gate open, guarded by the Germans or the Polish 
                  police, or together. We were told that we couldn't take with 
                  us, except whatever one could carry on his shoulders. No furniture, 
                  not even a bicycle. A family of 2 or 4, or 6, or 10 people was 
                  stuffed into a room. And if a house had 4 or 5 rooms, 30 or 
                  40 people sometimes ended up in the same house. Needless to 
                  say, one could find sleeping accommodations underground on a 
                  straw sack.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Every morning 
                  at 6:00 a.m., at the sound of a siren, we were told to line 
                  up for a head count in front of our houses on the main street. 
                  The Germans and the Polish police would come and take as many 
                  workers as they needed to work for them. Primarily to clean 
                  the barracks, to sweep the streets and the sidewalks of the 
                  city, or we were taken to the woods to cut down trees for the 
                  wood supply for the winter. After work we would be given a quarter 
                  soup, which consisted of some potatoes, some vegetables. I say 
                  some, because not everybody was lucky to get that. And this 
                  was our almost daily ration. Prior to that, we would be given 
                  a slice of bread and a piece of margarine, and this was it. 
                  Occasionally, we would be given some potatoes so we could perhaps 
                  boil them on the outside, at home. But needless to say, on a 
                  diet that consisted of maybe 800 or 900 calories, one didn't 
                  have to worry about gaining weight.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The worst 
                  thing to get used to was the uncertainty of what the next day 
                  will bring. Prior to the closing of the ghetto-and, of course, 
                  every Jew had to wear this yellow Star of David on his outer 
                  clothing, which was about 5 inches in diameter--anyone found 
                  not wearing the Star of David outside would be simply taken 
                  to the woods, or shot, or hanged, whatever. And, unfortunately, 
                  that's what happened to my father and my cousin. Shortly before 
                  the ghetto was closed, they went out to the nearest farmer to 
                  trade some of our belongings, that bedding or clothing, for 
                  food-potatoes, vegetables, whatever was available, flowers.<br>
                  They were rounded up by the Germans and because they didn't 
                  wear the yellow Star of David. Obviously, they couldn't wear 
                  it, otherwise they would have been caught right away&#133;.They 
                  were taken to the woods and shot. Now one would ask, how could 
                  the Germans tell whether you were Jewish or not. Very simple&#133;.In 
                  Europe, only the Jewish males were circumcised. This would give 
                  any Jew away.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There is 
                  no good time of losing a father, but since, to me, this was 
                  the worst time for us, we still had to go on. My brother and 
                  I were taken every day to work, most of the time in the woods 
                  and for the military. The women were taken somewhere else. In 
                  the beginning, little babies with young mothers were allowed 
                  to stay home. But then, the Germans realized that they were 
                  losing the labor that the mothers could provide. They took the 
                  babies, up to the age of 5 or 6, and promised to put them in 
                  a kindergarten, with visitation privileges, which they did allow 
                  the mothers to do. But, after the 2 weeks, the children and 
                  the elderly disappeared from the ghetto. And, of course, at 
                  that time we just couldn't comprehend that they would be taken 
                  away and killed, but that's what it turned out to be--the German 
                  plan. This was already at the end of 1941, to get rid of as 
                  many Jews as they could, starting with the babies, and the elderly, 
                  which they considered a non-productive element. Why feed them?</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">My brother 
                  and I were told to report to a Labor Camp. Our ghetto was ordered 
                  to supply about 500 young people. My mother and sister decided 
                  to join us, because we knew once were separated, we may never 
                  get together again. We ended up not far from the City of Vilna, 
                  now it's called Vilnius, building a parallel rail line, parallel 
                  to the existing one so the Germans would have two-way traffic 
                  to the eastern front and back. I contracted typhoid, because 
                  of the unsanitary conditions in the camp. As you know, typhoid 
                  is a very contagious disease. I was taken with another group 
                  of 23 youngsters to the ghetto of Vilma, which had the only 
                  hospital available. Once I recovered, I was allowed to stay 
                  in the ghetto of Vilna.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The ghetto 
                  of Vilna was much, much larger. At that time, it had about 120,000 
                  people, although it was the largest ghetto. The ghetto of Warsaw 
                  was much bigger, and the ghetto of Lodz I hear-that's where 
                  my wife comes from-had between 300,000 and 400,000 Jews.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When the 
                  work was finished in the camp, my brother, my mother, and my 
                  sister were allowed to join me in the ghetto. But we were reunited 
                  for a short period of time. My brother and I were going out, 
                  leaving the ghetto with another group, to the airport, to work 
                  there. They were enlarging the airport. The work, of course, 
                  was hard. Although the food rationing was just about the same-about 
                  800 or 900 calories-people were beginning to succumb to sickness. 
                  I mean elderly people. At that time, when I was 16-17, obviously 
                  anyone over 30 was, in my eyes, considered elderly.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Then, one 
                  day, we were rounded up at the airport, put into cattle wagons, 
                  and taken to Estonia. However, before we reached Estonia we 
                  were sure that we may end up in Bonari, which was about 15 kilometers 
                  from the City of Vilna, and it was a killing place. That's where 
                  the Germans would take all the Jews from the neighboring smaller 
                  ghettos, promising to take them to the ghetto of Vilma, but 
                  they never reached the ghetto. They reached Bonari. They were 
                  forced to run toward the mass prepared graves, and get undressed 
                  and they would be machine gunned.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Several 
                  of the youngsters that were ordered to bring the corpses to 
                  the graves-one can only imagine what went on under these circumstances. 
                  People, when they were exposed to shooting, began to scream, 
                  run, and hoping to escape. But, of course, they were hit, and 
                  fell on the ground, 50-100 feet away from the graves. The youngsters 
                  were supposed to drag their corpses and put them in the graves.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After the 
                  killing, the Germans were simply sitting back, relaxing, and 
                  boozing. Evidently, even for them, it was not an easy job to 
                  do. The youngsters realized that they would probably be shot, 
                  because the Germans did not want to have any witnesses, and 
                  if they could they would take a chance and try to escape. Since 
                  it was a wooded area, many of them, during the escape, were 
                  shot and killed. Half a dozen managed to escape. They reached 
                  the ghetto of Vilma and they told us what was going on in Bonari. 
                  Needless to say, we knew by then already that every Jew was 
                  sentenced to die. It was just a question of when, how, and where.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Knowing 
                  that, what could we do? Really, not much. Being on the cattle 
                  wagon on our way to Estonia&#133;.And, of course, we assumed 
                  that we would be taken to Bonari and face the same fate as our 
                  brothers and sisters. But, they needed us in Estonia, where 
                  they put us to dig test wells for shale deposits. And when the 
                  deposits were located, then they built a mine and we had to 
                  mine the shale. The Germans had a way from extracting oil from 
                  the shale deposits.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In order 
                  to try to fill in, I have to abbreviate my story. I'm sticking 
                  to too many details. Estonian winters were cold. Lots of snow. 
                  People began to succumb to sickness and die. The Russians began 
                  to push the Germans out of Russia, Estonia, Lithuania, and Latvia. 
                  When the Germans retreated, for some reason they took the inmates 
                  from this particular camp with them. We will never know why 
                  the other camps were liquidated, by putting the people in barracks 
                  and simply blowing them up. We would not ask any questions. 
                  We were given orders to do this. Anyone that was silly enough 
                  to inquire would simply get a beating that he'll never forget. 
                  We were given a loaf of bread and marched to the port of Tallin, 
                  which is on the Baltic Sea.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After 3 
                  days of walking, we arrived in Tallin, put on a German merchant 
                  boat, and after a seasickening ride, we came to the port of 
                  Danzig, and from there we walked at night for another 3 or 4 
                  hours, to a place which was called Stutthof. Stutthof is a concentration 
                  camp. It had a gas chamber and a crematorium. When I arrived 
                  at Stutthof, I had a tattoo on my arm, which is 79,970. That's 
                  how many inmates were in Stutthof at that time. Although the 
                  population doubled shortly, because they were bringing in transports, 
                  trainloads of Jews from Hungary and Rumania. Stutthof was a 
                  warehouse where they kept the people. We didn't work in Stutthof. 
                  Periodically, some German representatives would come to Stutthof 
                  and pick workers for their factories. One can imagine a slave 
                  market, where we were lined up in columns of 100, our shirts 
                  off, and the Germans would pass by and pick the ones that still 
                  had any meat on their body, and that looked like a better working 
                  specimen.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The ones 
                  left behind had to contend with the fact that the smell of the 
                  crematorium, of burning human flesh, and the smoke from the 
                  crematorium chimney were just a reminder that our days were 
                  limited. We envied the people that were picked to be taken out 
                  of Stutthof. However, after a few months, the same people would 
                  return to Stutthof in very debilitated condition. Like ghosts 
                  in slow motion. They would be taken to the gas chamber, in order 
                  to get rid of a large group of people.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At one time, 
                  my brother and I were picked to go out. We were put, again, 
                  in cattle wagons, and taken to the smaller concentration camp 
                  of Neungamme, which is near the Dutch border, near the cities 
                  of Aurich and Meppen. There, we would be put to dig anti-tank 
                  trenches, because the second Allied front was already attacked, 
                  and the work, again, was very, very hard. By that time, we were 
                  so deteriorated physically that I just wonder how one could 
                  be exposed to such hard labor and still be able to stand on 
                  our feet.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When the 
                  work was done, they took us back to Stutthof. This was already 
                  the beginning of 1945. We were told that&#133;..We already knew 
                  that the Germans were losing the war. How did we know? We didn't 
                  have any newspapers, any radio, not a watch, nothing&#133;.We 
                  were completely cut off from the world. But, occasionally, people 
                  that worked on the farms were able to pick up a discarded magazine 
                  or newspaper, read the headlines, and come to the camp and tell 
                  us. So, we knew that the Germans were retreating, and we knew 
                  that the war would come to an end, eventually. The question 
                  was whether we would be around to face liberation. It was a 
                  very hopeless situation, because I could see people around me 
                  that I talked to two days earlier&#133;.They were sitting on 
                  the ground, dead.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One day, 
                  again, we were given a loaf of bread, put into cattle wagons-usually 
                  100 people per cattle wagon. Whenever we were given bread, we 
                  knew that we would go somewhere. They dragged us around for 
                  almost 2 weeks, back and forth. The Germans were surrounded 
                  by the allied forces. And then the train stopped near Hanover. 
                  I think it was a station called Pferden . We were told to get 
                  out of the cattle wagons. Most of us had to be taken out, because 
                  we were too weak, physically to do it by ourselves. We were 
                  put on the ground. The train took off. Still guarded by the 
                  Nazis, with their machine guns pointed at us, although we didn't 
                  have the strength to walk, never mind run.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Again, we 
                  were sure that these were probably the last hours that we would 
                  be around. Then, they forced us to crawl on our hands and knees, 
                  (Whoever could walk, of course, could walk) for about a mile, 
                  and we ended up near a POW camp. They put us in the adjacent 
                  camp that was still under construction. We didn't get any food 
                  for, maybe, 3 days. The day after we reached the camp, and, 
                  I mean, most of the barracks were unfinished. My brother and 
                  I ended up in a dug out hole, and that's where we spent the 
                  night. The following day we were given some soup. We stayed 
                  there for about a week, and then we heard the ground was rumbling, 
                  and we knew that these were not German tanks, because somehow 
                  we figured the German tanks probably wouldn't be around here. 
                  These were the British forces that liberated us on the 28th 
                  of April, 1945.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The prisoners 
                  from the adjacent camp came over from the other side. They brought 
                  with them a lot of food, because they stole the warehouses.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Both my 
                  brother and I succumbed to disintery and typhoid because our 
                  systems were not used to the rich, canned food that was given 
                  to us. We developed disyntery. And, unfortunately, the British 
                  did not expect to find so many sick people that required immediate 
                  attention. There's an unknown figure of how many survivors died 
                  after liberation. The British tried to help as much as they 
                  could, obviously, but that was the case.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We were 
                  separated. I was taken to a temporary hospital, and so was my 
                  brother, in a different place. When I was well enough to walk 
                  around and look for my brother, I just couldn't find him. As 
                  I say, not only did we have beards on our faces, and the people 
                  were lying on the ground, on straw sacks in the temporary tents. 
                  I remember walking by and looking into every person's face, 
                  trying to find my brother, but I couldn't.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The people 
                  from my camp were scheduled to go to Sweden for recuperation. 
                  Sweden decided to take in about 100,000 survivors for recuperation, 
                  and I was scheduled to go there too, not knowing all along what 
                  happened to my brother. When I arrived in Bergen-Belsen (that's 
                  where the ghettoing point was), on top of a British military 
                  truck, for the first time I saw women that went toward us. Their 
                  heads were shaven, in striped clothing. When they reached us, 
                  they were inquiring who we were, what camp we were in, what 
                  part of Poland we were from. In other words, they were looking 
                  for their husbands, brothers, etc. Seeing women-because, until 
                  then, I was sure that women had no chance of surviving-that 
                  made me think, suppose my mother, or sister, or both of them, 
                  are somewhere alive. How will I ever get in touch with them. 
                  I knew Sweden was in the other side of the Baltic Sea. I decided 
                  right there, I am not going to Sweden.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I stayed 
                  in the camp. The transport left. Of course, Bergen-Belsen had 
                  at that time had about maybe 8,000-10,000 survivors. I wrote 
                  to my Aunt in Israel-the only permanent address I could think 
                  of-letting her know that I was alive. My mother, that was liberated 
                  by the Russian forces-my mother and sister. And that time, where 
                  in the community center of Lodz did the same. She wrote to her 
                  sister, letting her know that she and her daughter is alive. 
                  Through my Aunt, I found out that she was alive. When my mother 
                  heard that I am in Bergen-Belsen, they decided to cross the 
                  border of Czechoslovakia into Germany, and we were reunited 
                  in July, I believe the 7th of July.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When I mentioned 
                  to my mother that I really didn't know what happened to my brother, 
                  we went to the same hospital in Rottenberg, Germany, and after 
                  looking over the various papers we found that he passed away 
                  on May 19, 1945, and was buried in a mass grave with about 4,000 
                  people, after the liberation. Needless to say, it was a great 
                  shock for my mother. But, at the same time, we knew that we 
                  were probably one of the few families where more than one member 
                  survived. Life had to go on.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I met my 
                  wife, Judy, in the camp of Bergen-Belsen, and she survived with 
                  her mother also. My mother and sister went to Israel, when the 
                  State of Israel was established. I stayed in Bergen-Belsen for 
                  a short while later, because I wanted to finish the ORT school 
                  (trade school) that I attended. But then, the war of liberation 
                  in 1948 in Israel broke out. I got a letter from my mother. 
                  You got out of one fire, don't get into another. Wait until 
                  the war will end. We listened to my mother's suggestion.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Meanwhile, 
                  the American Government passed a law to permit 300,000 DP's 
                  (displaced persons) to enter the United States above the normal 
                  quota. We signed up for it, not really thinking anything would 
                  come out of it, and 2 weeks later we were told to be ready, 
                  so we packed our belongings and two suitcases, and were taken 
                  to a temporary transit camp. From there, we came by plane, because 
                  my wife was pregnant with my son, and it was already too late 
                  for her to go by boat. We arrived on June 24, 1949 to the United 
                  States.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We are grateful 
                  for the opportunity to go back to a normal life, and for the 
                  tragedy of the Holocaust on the back burner, because it isn't 
                  something one can forget.</font></p>
