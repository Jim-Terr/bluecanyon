          <br>
          <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">© By Jim Terr 2000 
          </font></font></b></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Unlike 
          many of Dr. Laura Schlessinger's most persistent critics, I consider 
          her to be a real treasure in many respects-insightful, intuitive and 
          often compassionate in dealing with many of her callers' problems and 
          "moral dilemmas." Her priorities and her concerns are in line with many 
          of my own, and I dare I say I've even learned a few things from her! 
          </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
          some ways, however, I consider Dr. Laura to be a menace, on a par with 
          some of the people and trends which she demonizes daily on her radio 
          and TV programs. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Take 
          her attitude on gays. The past year's flood of letters, editorials, 
          protests and ad campaigns directed at Dr. Laura's "hatred" of gays is 
          generally overblown in one respect: I have listened to Dr. Laura for 
          several hours a week for the past couple of years, and I would not describe 
          her attitude toward homosexuals as one of "hate." She claims-and I'll 
          take her at her word-to know and respect many gays. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But 
          I've also heard her describe the urge to homosexuality as a "mistake," 
          a biological "error" and "deviance," and this is what has enraged many 
          gay individuals and organizations. Dr. Laura has, in her defense, tried 
          to distinguish between the individual and the behavior, between the 
          sinner and the sin. I have heard her say many times that gays are okay 
          with her, as long as they don't actually practice homosexuality. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This 
          is like saying that I appreciate Dr. Laura as a person, as long as she 
          doesn't actually exercise her overpowering urge to share her wisdom 
          on the radio. That is clearly Dr. Laura's most salient talent, her most 
          basic instinct, and to deny her this outlet would be to deny her most 
          natural source of self-expression and satisfaction-not to mention her 
          livelihood. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When 
          pressed, Dr. Laura justifies her hard stance on gay abstention by quoting 
          Scripture (selectively, of course, as most Scripture-quoters seem to 
          do), and by a sort of converse logic: the basic, Biblically-ordained 
          relationship is that of man and woman, so that the earth may be populated, 
          and according to Dr. Laura any deviation from that is not only anti-Biblical 
          and evil but counter-productive as well. Has anyone told Dr. Laura that 
          the earth currently has upwards of six billion inhabitants, mostly overcrowded 
          and underfed, and that populating the earth is no longer the same imperative 
          it was 4,000 years ago? Does Dr. Laura condemn single people, or married 
          heterosexual couples who have chosen not to produce children? No, she 
          does not. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Then 
          where does she get off denying pleasure and fulfillment to those gay 
          couples who wish to enjoy their lives and mind their own business, as 
          Dr. Laura is privileged to do? How does her often-stated (and often-demonstrated) 
          sense of compassion square with this particular crusade of hers? Why 
          are homosexuals singled out for torment by this woman with so much good 
          sense and compassion in so many other areas? Why does she interpret 
          every attempt by gays to gain the same rights as everyone else, to be 
          an "anti-family" conspiracy? </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dr. 
          Laura has stated that attacks on her serve only to increase her popularity. 
          To the extent that such attacks are inflated and inaccurate, she is 
          probably right, since she flaunts them as examples of how she is unfairly 
          persecuted by the press and the public. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But 
          on this one issue, if she ever decides to put as much energy into introspection 
          as she currently puts into attack and counter-attack, she may find that 
          she owes her listeners-especially the gays whom she has hurt directly 
          and indirectly-a sincere apology. </font></p>

          <b><font color="#990000">COURAGE, CHARACTER and APPLE PIE <br>
          <font size="2">©2000 Jim Terr (740 words) </font></font></b> </font></p>
        <p align="left"> Each of our two leading contenders for the presidency 
          would like us to think that they have more character than the other, 
          more courage, a greater portion of trustworthiness and integrity. Aside 
          from the self-puffery that this represents, which only a few years ago 
          would have been considered immodest, what lies behind these claims to 
          moral superiority? </p>
        <p align="left">On the part of Governor Bush, these references to his 
          superior morality are code words meant to imply that there will be no 
          extra-marital dalliance in his White House, no unacknowledged fundraisers 
          in Buddhist temples, and none of the general dishonesty and disingenuousness 
          that hard-core conservatives agree is the key operating principle of 
          the Clinton-Gore Administration. </p>
        <p align="left">On the part of Vice President Gore, any hints at higher 
          ground might be taken as references to Bush's blatant corporate cronyism 
          in his choice of advisors, appointed boards and running mate, not to 
          mention his general fealty to the wealthy. </p>
        <p align="left">Bush's tragically absurd certainty about the guilt of 
          everyone executed in Texas, both men's devotion to The Government/Business 
          Revolving Door and The Big Spin Machine-the departures from Principle 
          are nearly endless. </p>
        <p align="left">But where is the real courage, character and integrity? 
          Which of these candidates has the courage to question pumping up a military 
          budget that already comprises 51% of our federal expenditures-a budget 
          already $41 billion over what the Pentagon requested for the past six 
          years--in a time of relative peace?** And how about an extra $60 billion 
          for a "Star Wars" system that most scientists and household tinkerers 
          agree would never work, would only make the Russians feel more edgy, 
          and which would be directed only at a country stupid enough to send 
          us a missile with their return address on it rather than just bringing 
          in an atomic weapon in a suitcase? </p>
        <p align="left">Where is the character in the fact that neither of these 
          candidates had the decency-or even the political savvy-to ask for prayers 
          for the crewmen of the Russian submarine "Kursk" when the rest of the 
          country was agonizing over their fate? Or would that have been too politically 
          risky, something that there was insufficient time to hold a focus group 
          about? </p>
        <p align="left">Where is the character in Al Gore failing to thank George 
          Bush for participating in the first presidential debate, even after 
          Bush thanked Gore? Where is the courage in both of these candidates' 
          unwillingness to invite Ralph Nader to join in? Where is the commitment 
          to democracy, when polls show consistently that between 60 and 64 per 
          cent of Americans wish to see them debate Nader? </p>
        <p align="left">Where is the integrity in failing to "step outside the 
          box" for a moment to address such non-focus-group-tested questions as 
          "If humans do not inhabit the earth in 50 years, what will have been 
          the most likely reason, and what have I done to address it?" Whether 
          the answer is nuclear war, depleted topsoil and water supplies or other 
          environmental devastation-all good possibilities-could we hear a few 
          words about it? </p>
        <p align="left">Where is the courage in not taking one moment out of the 
          thousands of hours of self-promotion and chest-beating in their campaigns, 
          to talk about how the starvation, disease and suffering which afflict 
          a great portion of our fellow human beings might be alleviated by this 
          bountiful, creative country, and whether this might contribute more 
          to our spiritual well-being than a perfect record of marital fidelity 
          while in office? </p>
        <p align="left">Where is the leadership in both of these gentlemen's unwillingness 
          to call a moratorium on unregulated "soft money" TV campaign ads, the 
          most blatant example of a system so rotten that even they must recognize 
          it? If Rick Lazio and Hillary Clinton can do the same in the media- 
          and money-rich environment of New York, why can't these two do it, too? 
          Are they both willing to admit that they're this crass and this powerless? 
        </p>
        <p align="left">But okay, forget about what I think is important, what 
          I think would be some good indicators of courage, character and integrity. 
          I'd ask these candidates (are you listening, Jim Lehrer?): What have 
          you done, on the campaign trail or elsewhere this year, that involves 
          any real courage or self-sacrifice, beyond simple self-aggrandizement 
          and posturing? </p>
        <p align="left">In short, where's the courage to say something-anything!-about 
          some of the things that are wrong in our world that can't be blamed 
          on Democrats or Republicans, something that's obvious to the rest of 
          us, something meaningful, something of real personal concern, without 
          being paralyzed by the fear of having it turned into a negative TV sound 
          bite? Do either of these men really have the faith in the American people 
          that they claim to have? </p>

          Pay Jennings and Rather what we make and they'll figure what the heck?

          As long as they run what we supply, the boobs at home will see <br>

          OLD FASHIONED WEB SITE <br>
          ©2000 Jim Terr</b></font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Buddy's 
          just a good old boy, sellin' good used cars, <br>
          And singin' good old country songs, down at Brenda's Bar. <br>
          A buddy to the workin' man, and trust fund babies, too. <br>
          To make a friend and keep one, there's nothin' he won't do...</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now 
          Buddy's known for quite a while he's gonna have to be <br>
          A vital if reluctant part of the 21st century. -- <br>
          So with some good old ingenuity and parts right off the shelf, <br>
          Buddy's built a web site, that's like the man himself:</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">No 
          digital information, just a few old moving parts, <br>
          Always workin', more or less, and that takes a little art...<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-"You're darn right!"-- <br>
          Yeah there's just one place on the Internet <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that'll get you through a long and lonely 
          night... <br>
          That's Buddy's, Old Fashioned, ("Never fancy, hardly dashin'") Web Site.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Its 
          images are stored on VHS tapes you can trust. <br>
          And the sound on good old 8-tracks that will not jam or bust. <br>
          Recycled electrons, are the only kind it uses. <br>
          "If the darn thing ever overloads, it just blows a couple fuses."</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So 
          whatever sort of problem's got your undershorts in a knot <br>
          Just go to Buddy's Web Site and he'll give it all he's got. <br>
          Personal, romantic questions "whatever", his expertise he'll lend... 
          <br>
          When in doubt, remember Buddy's motto, "We just wanna be your friend!" 
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Play somethin' friendly now"... .( instl. 
          break w/ spark/shock fx at end) <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That was absolutely shocking! Haw-awright!"</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Yeah, 
          when this brave new world has got you down, <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; there's one place to go to make it right: 
          <br>
          Drop by Buddy's absolutely free,"just waitin' there for you and me," 
          <br>
          Solar-powered, not for cowards, "methane backup (what a crackup!)", 
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Low-speed modem, ("Guess I showed em!")-- <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all wood, no plastic, just fantastic, -- <br>
          Buddy's always runnin, never crashin', <br>
          almost ancient, good old fashioned... (gtr run) Web Site........ <br>
          ..."And remember, it's made in the USA. <br>
