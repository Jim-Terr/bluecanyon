            <p align="left" class="style3">YouTube &ndash; A   Natural Home For Jim Terr</p>
            <p align="left" class="style1"><strong>&nbsp;Nearly 450,000   Hits For The Santa   Fe   Entertainer</strong></p>
            <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
            <p align="left"><strong>YouTube </strong>is now   well established as one of the most viewed websites on the internet, its   reputation enhanced by its diversity &hellip;. a natural home for   Santa   Fe&rsquo;s <strong>Jim Terr</strong>, equally known for an   unpredictable approach to the world of entertainment.&nbsp;</p>
            <p align="left">To date he has uploaded 210 videos   on the site, attracting around 450,000 viewers. Terr admits that this <em>&ldquo;does not compare with those people who put up the   odd video that gets ten million views, or big stars who routinely get a few   hundred thousand&rdquo;</em> but, taking a closer look at his contributions, his   profile is unique in terms of the range of material. </p>
            <p align="left">Initially making his mark as a   singer, songwriter and record producer &ndash; among the artists he's worked with are   <strong><a href="http://steveyoung.net/">Steve Young</a>, <a href="http://www.kathychiavola.com">Kathy Chiavola</a>, Junior   Brown</strong>&nbsp;and Hollywood actor <strong><strong>Slim Pickens</strong></strong> &ndash; he   further developed his talents as satirist, political commentator, filmmaker and   author (&ldquo;You Got To Be Stupid To Sing Country Music&rdquo;), earning respect and   acclaim from many of his peers including humorist <strong>Dave Barry</strong> who described him as <em>&ldquo;bodacious&rdquo;.</em> <strong>Billboard&nbsp;</strong>wrote<em> &ldquo;well-done songs with a topical edge, with humour, a   point of view and a concern for human dignity...a wonderful surprise...&quot; </em>while, in the   UK, <strong><strong>Country Music   People</strong></strong>, in reviewing Terr's&nbsp;&quot;Demos &amp;&nbsp;Diamonds&quot;   cd,<strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></strong>&nbsp;commented&nbsp;that he was   a<em><em> &quot;cross between   Tom Lehrer and Ray Stevens</em></em>...<em><em>sorely needed comedy in these   uncertain times&quot;.&nbsp;</em></em></p>
            <p align="left"><em><em></em></em>&nbsp;Consequently <strong>YouTube</strong> has&nbsp;provided a welcomed outlet for <strong>Jim Terr</strong>&rsquo;s creative talents, his   humour often providing the foundation for a succession of short video clips,   ranging from the mainstream to the bizarre, with a number gaining attention at   Film Festivals.</p>
            <p align="left">Currently Terr&rsquo;s most viewed <strong><strong>YouTube</strong></strong> presentations   are <strong>One Year Old Child Prodigy Piano   Genius</strong>, an inane 45 second effort, and <strong>Please Impeach Me</strong>, a parody on George W.   Bush (to the tune of &ldquo;Please Release Me&rdquo;), released during his time in the White   Horse. Song parodies figure frequently in the Terr repertoire and other such   videos include <strong>Johnny Cash Personal   Ads</strong> (&ldquo;I Walk The Line&rdquo;), <strong>If I Had   Some   Grammar</strong> (&ldquo;If I Had A Hammer&rdquo;) and <strong>Drill Baby</strong> (&ldquo;Dream Baby&rdquo;), another   political rant, this time with Sarah Palin as the composer&rsquo;s target. </p>
            <p align="left">Not overlooking his native state,   Terr has made videos on many aspects of his home town <strong>Santa Fe</strong> (including the <strong>Farmer&rsquo;s Market</strong>, <strong><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMLvjwdyHMs">Stop Signs</a></strong> and <strong>Cowgirl Hall of Fame</strong>) as well as the   neighbouring <strong>Las Vegas</strong> (the   original town bearing that name, his home town,&nbsp;and once known as the most violent town in the West) and   the more general<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkt7gtnSztk"> <strong>23 Views Of New   Mexico</strong></a> (a 5 minute condensation of his 110 minute documentary). Not   overlooking New   Mexico&rsquo;s considerable popularity for   filmmakers, he created <strong><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFXBuUqPPzc">No Country For Old   Satirists</a></strong>, filmed in Las   Vegas and inspired by the   Oscar-winning   &ldquo;Old Men&rdquo; original &ndash;   which was largely filmed there.</p>
            <p align="left">There&rsquo;s also several videos of <strong>Jim Terr</strong> as musician, with <em><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=povgDnXH94w">Did It Hurt When You Fell From   Heaven</a></em> and <em><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAjy6BWVew8">Do They Have e-Mail In   Heaven</a> </em>ranking among his most popular live performances, while other   artists to be seen in his videos are <strong><a title="blocked::http://www.kathychiavola.com/" href="http://www.kathychiavola.com/"><span title="blocked::http://www.kathychiavola.com"/></span></span>Kathy Chiavola</SPAN></a>,   Elliott&rsquo;s Ramblers </strong>and veteran entertainer <strong>George Bullfrog</strong> (of the <strong>Last Mile Ramblers</strong>) &ndash; but not forgetting   Terr&rsquo;s associate <strong><a href="http://www.buddysoldfashionedwebsite.com">BuDDy</a> </strong>(who always   wants <em>&ldquo;to be your friend&rdquo;</em>), a   character known for his <em><em>&ldquo;unconventional good looks, frog-like voice and   beer belly</em></em>&rdquo;.</p>
            <p align="left">All Jim Terr&rsquo;s videos can be found   by entering the name <strong>HYMIEHYMIE</strong> in   the <strong>YouTube</strong> search   box.</p>
            <p align="left"><em>&ldquo;YouTube is a   great boon for someone like me&rdquo;</em> Terr says. <em>&ldquo;Not only do I get to share what interests me, what   amuses me, and allows me to stretch my creativity, it&rsquo;s also a sales tool for my   video work in some cases&rdquo;.</em> Besides performing the occasional song demo, he&rsquo;s also used this outlet for   feature film projects that he&rsquo;s trying to get off the ground, the most current   being <strong>&ldquo;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KiuonpyidU">Girl Group Rumble</a>&rdquo; </strong>and <strong>&ldquo;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-qpad6SNiI">Invested</a>&rdquo;</strong>. (He also continues to   pursue his country music interests, his latest project being <strong>&ldquo;<a href="http://www.DangerousCountry.com">Dangerous Country</a>&rdquo;</strong>, an alternative to   Nashville   country!).</p>
            <p align="left">Although he admits that his videos   don&rsquo;t attract mass audiences, <strong>Jim   Terr</strong>&rsquo;s work has picked up cult status, attracting viewers way beyond   the boundaries of Santa Fe, with the   diversity of his work ensures that &ldquo;predictability&rdquo; will never be a keyword to   his talents.&nbsp;But it's&nbsp;guaranteed that another few minutes of his creativity will   be debuting on <strong>YouTube</strong> (<a title="blocked::http://www.youtube.com/" href="http://www.youtube.com">www.youtube.com</a>) at any   moment!</p>
