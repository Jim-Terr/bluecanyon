      <td><em>&quot;I think he was a <strong>very</strong> American success story. Here was a classic Jewish   immigrant, fleeing violence and oppression, who came to a new country   with big dreams. He worked with hands and back and mind, had a family,   made a living, left a legacy that lasts to this day, and even gained a   measure of fame. He only failed financially, and in so far as being   unable to make his fame into superstardom.<br />
        <br />
Of course the   life long money troubles and fall into relative obscurity aren't part of   the normal American Success Story pattern, but I think they make his story <strong>more</strong> powerful.&quot;</em></td>

          ..1939, Joe is 46, walking through New York, and he sees a sign on a building saying, <strong>&quot;No Jews or dogs allowed.&quot;</strong> He asks around, and finds out that the building is the headquarters of the German-American Bund -- the American Nazi Party. <br />
          <br />
          So get gets a ladder and a Louisville Slugger. Tears down the sign. And throws it on the twenty or thirty Bund members who've come out of the building. Naturally, they decide to kill him. The police come and break it and arrest the whole mess.<br />
          <br />
          On one side of the courtroom, you've got twenty Bund members, each pounded to crap -- broken noses, arms, legs, whatever. Represented by a lawyer who works for the Bund.<br />
          <br />
          On the other side, you've got Joe.<br />
          <br />
          The judge is kind of baffled by this. He's not sure why there can be TWENTY people on ONE side, and just ONE on the OTHER side. He asks the arresting officer if there weren't more people involved, maybe?<br />
          <br />
          Yes, yes there were, the officer confirms. Six of the Bund members haven't yet left the hospital.  (c) <br />

        <p> <strong>Greenstein had regular run ins with the KKK and American Nazis</strong> throughout the 30s. He was a trained fighter and performer, a high profile Jewish immigrant with a large family. </p>
        <p>At one point  he purchased a gas station and settled his family in, attempting to give up show business for something more stable (his Vaudeville career was in decline). The man who sold the station to Greenstein regretted the deal, and the local Klan decided to terrorize him into leaving. Several crude attempts at direct intimidation failed. </p>
        <p>Eventually, Greenstein was kidnapped at gun point by a small group of masked Klansmen, tied, and left briefly alone. He believed they intended to kill him. <strong>He broke the ropes (breaking ropes and chains was part of his act,</strong> and not a trick save in the sense that it was a skill he had trained to perform), returned to town on foot, and recognized two of the men who had kidnapped him without their masks. </p>
        <p><strong>Free and now armed with a butcher's knife, </strong>he chased them off; kidnapping a man out of public view was one thing, but they weren't confident enough to confront him on a public street. <br />

            <br />
          &quot;My grandfather (H..., the painter) owned a tailor shop in Philadelphia at the time. The Bundists came by in 1939 and told him they wanted his shop closed. Hyman was a WWI vet. He called his buddies from the 79th Division, 315th Infantry Association. The next time the Bundists came by the Infantryman met them. From then on, almost until the end of the war, there were always two Infantrymen in the shop. </p>

        <div class="style5"> At that time during a part of 1939, I was in college and   working at night as a stock clerk at&nbsp; Crawford Clothes.&nbsp; One of their   stores was on&nbsp; 86th&nbsp; street in Manhattan.&nbsp;&nbsp; This section is   known as Yorkville and it was a hotbed for USA Nazis.</div>

        <div class="style5">While dining there,&nbsp; a group of Nazis came in bragging   about their movement and finally one said &ldquo;show me a Jew and I&rsquo;ll show you what   I can do &ldquo;</div>
