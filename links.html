              <span class="style135">When submitting a public service message idea to the New Mexico Department of  Transportation, please follow these simple guidelines: DON&rsquo;T DO IT!!!<br>
              <br>
                Take it from me, a guy with a fairly good public record of creative work  (including the VERY long-running &ldquo;Toss No Mas&rdquo; jingle. &nbsp;I submitted an idea which arguably, years  later, resulted in the popular NMDOT &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Text&rdquo; video,&nbsp; &ldquo;DNTXT:  Deadly Conversation&rdquo;.&nbsp; (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwta1bxyLGw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwta1bxyLGw</a> )&nbsp; </span></p>
        <p class="style135">When  I made the Department aware of my earlier submission, and gently suggested they  pay me what I had requested as a creative fee in the first place, they politely  declined, based on technicalities**, while not actually denying that my idea  may have likely resulted in the current campaign. <br>
              <br>
          This is the highly principled, morality-in-government, &ldquo;do the right thing&rdquo; Martinez  administration, by the way. So, until further notice, and until they decide to  do the right thing, my suggested guideline for&nbsp;  submitting ideas remains: DON&rsquo;T DO IT!<br>
