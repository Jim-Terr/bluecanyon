                  your 7-17-02 story about the controversy surrounding including 
                  an HIV-positive character in the South African edition of Sesame 
                  Street:</font></u><strong><u><font size="3"><br />
                  </font></u></strong><font size="3"><br />
                  The self-appointed family values spokesman who complained that 
                  the Sesame Street portrayal is an example of sexualization of 
                  children, and that it &quot;normalizes&quot; deviant behavior, 
                  demonstrates how spectacularly ignorant and mean-spirited some 
                  of these self-righteous moralists can be. <br />
                  <br />
                  Babies contract HIV from their mothers, not from sexual activity, 
                  and unfortunately pediatric HIV infection <em>is</em> quite 
                  common on the African continent.<br />
                  <br />
                  Likewise, the US congressman who hurried to make sure that no 
                  US funding was involved in this production, shows the Ugly American 
                  syndrome at its worst. God forbid a program like Sesame Street 
                  should foster better treatment of HIV-infected children, and 
                  an awareness that they are not likely to infect other children 
                  in the course of normal play.<br />
