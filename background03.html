            Exploding executive pay: justified by merit? </font><br>
            </strong></p>
          <p><em>(<a href="http://thomasash.hypermart.net/politicsandsociety/kangas-richmerit.html">See 
            complete article</a> -- and note that these figures are only up to 
            1995. Guess how much it's gone up since then...)</em></p>
          <p>In the last 20 years, total pay and compensation of America's top 
            executives have been exploding. Graef Crystal is undoubtedly the United 
            States' most renowned expert on this phenomenon, and his book, <em>In 
            Search of Excess: The Overcompensation of American Executives</em>, 
            commonly serves as the starting point for all debate. (8)</p>
          <p>The statistics Crystal reports are not in dispute. Among the 500 
            biggest firms in the U.S., average CEO compensation in 1975 was 41 
            times what an average worker earned. By 1995, that ratio had soared 
            to 197 times. (Again, <u>are CEOs five times smarter and harder working 
            than they were 20 years ago?</u> Of course not. Many are the same 
            people.) From 1994 to 1995 alone, CEO compensation rose 16 percent, 
            compared to 2.8 percent for workers, which did not even keep pace 
            with inflation. Their stagnating wages cannot be blamed on corporate 
            profits, which rose a healthy 14.8 percent for that year.</p>
          <!--msthemeseparator--><p align="center"><img src="_themes/checkers/achrule.gif" width="516" height="10"></p>
          <p><strong>Average CEO pay jumps 535% in 1990's<em><br>
            </em></strong><em><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(<a href="http://www.allianceibm.org/articles/ceopay.htm">http://www.allianceibm.org/articles/ceopay.htm</a>)</font> 
            </em></p>
          <p>11/02/00</p>
          <p>Growth in executive salaries over the last decade has far exceeded 
            any growth in average worker salaries for the same time period. The 
            gap in compensation between the average U.S. worker and his/her CEO 
            becomes wider and wider each year. Even corporate profits themselves 
            have grown at a much slower rate then executive compensation.</p>
          <p><strong>From a recent study:</strong> <br>
            &quot;A new study reveals growing pay gaps between workers and CEOs 
            and between CEOs and government officials that are increasing inequality 
            and undermining democracy. CEO pay jumped 535% in the 1990s, dwarfing 
            the 297% rise in the S&amp;P 500, 116% rise in corporate profits and 
            32% increase in average worker pay (not adjusted for inflation). The 
            pay gap between CEOs and the President of the United States has grown 
            from 2:1 to 62:1 since 1960, reports the Institute for Policy Studies 
            and United for a Fair Economy in Executive Excess 2000.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;If average pay for production workers had grown at the same 
            rate as it has for CEOs during this boom, instead of barely outpacing 
            inflation, their 1999 annual earnings would have been $114,035 instead 
            of $23,753. <strong>If the minimum wage had risen as fast as CEO pay, 
            it would now be $24.13 an hour, instead of $5.15.&quot;</strong></p>

            THE GREATEST STORY EVER TOLD </font></strong> </p>
          <p>One bitterly cold night in January of 1935, the mayor (New York <strong>Mayor 
            Fiorello LaGuardia</strong>) turned up at a night court that served 
            the poorest ward of the city. LaGuardia dismissed the judge for the 
            evening and took over the bench himself. Within a few minutes, a tattered 
            old woman was brought before him, charged with stealing a loaf of 
            bread. She told LaGuardia that her daughter’s husband had deserted 
            her, her daughter was sick, and her two grandchildren were starving.</p>
          <p>But the shopkeeper, from whom the bread was stolen, refused to drop 
            the charges. “It’s a real bad neighborhood, Your Honor,” the man told 
            the mayor. “She’s got to be punished to teach other people around 
            here a lesson.”</p>
          <p>LaGuardia sighed. He turned to the woman and said, “I’ve got to punish 
            you. The law makes no exceptions. Ten dollars or ten days in jail.” 
            But even as he pronounced sentence, the mayor was already reaching 
            into his pocket. He extracted a bill and tossed it into his famous 
            hat, saying, “Here is the ten dollar fine which I now remit; and furthermore, 
            I am going to fine everyone in this courtroom fifty cents for living 
            in a town where a person has to steal bread so that her grandchildren 
            can eat. Mr. Bailiff, collect the fines and give them to the defendant.”</p>
          <p>The following day, New York City newspapers reported that $47.50 
            was turned over to a bewildered woman who had stolen a loaf of bread 
            to feed her starving grandchildren. Fifty cents of that amount was 
            contributed by the grocery store owner himself, while some seventy 
            petty criminals, people with traffic violations, and New York City 
            policemen, each of whom had just paid fifty cents for the privilege 
            of doing so, gave the mayor a standing ovation.</p>

            Not sure about the authenticity of this, but interesting nonetheless 
            (snatched from cyberspace 10-7-02):</font><br>
          </p>
          <p><strong>LETTER FROM A FORMER CABINET SECRETARY </strong></p>
          <p>Dear Nephew,</p>
          <p>You have asked for my view of the current goings-on, from my vantage 
            point as a former cabinet secretary. I am afraid you may get more 
            than you asked for, and probably considerably darker than you expected.</p>
          <p>Yes, you may do what you like with this letter, short of identifying 
            me. I hope that you will understand the arcane rules of the world 
            in which I live, which dictate that I not go entirely public with 
            this, and not judge me too harshly for it. Certain strictures apply 
            to a man almost in his nineties, not entirely disengaged from the 
            battle yet not entirely independent.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, my age also gives me a somewhat devil-may-care 
            desire to share what I observe, while I still have eyes to see and 
            a mouth to speak. <br>
            <br>
            You have noticed, I hope, that much of what passes for public discourse 
            in this country is nothing of the sort, but rather a sort of fear-based 
            game of &quot;dodge-em.&quot; On the congressional level, for instance, 
            a remarkable number of votes are dictated by a fear of how one's vote 
            may be <em>misrepresented</em> in an opponent's speech or negative 
            campaign ad, whether next week or next year. Therefore you have the 
            strange phenomenon of the House and Senate voting to support the very 
            personal battle plans of a war-obsessed president in spite of overwhelming 
            public opposition to it, as measured by constituent mail and phone 
            calls. </p>
          <p>In other words, it is less important that I vote as my constituents 
            wish me to vote, or even as my conscience and senses dictate, than 
            that I vote in such a way that my opponent be unable, in that sort 
            of snarling, grainy, melodramatic campaign ad that has become so common, 
            to accuse me of voting against &quot;American security&quot; or &quot;giving 
            comfort to a dictator who supports terrorism and threatens Americans,&quot; 
            or however the charge will undoubtedly be flung in forthcoming campaign 
            commercials.</p>
          <p>Which brings us to the dictator in question. Certainly an unpleasant 
            man who makes life miserable for his own people, and who could hardly 
            be replaced by anyone worse. But the American administration's sudden 
            fixation on him, on the urgency of his removal at any cost, would 
            be more credible if he were not seemingly picked almost at random 
            from any number of equally heinous dictators.</p>
          <p>The strongest charges made to portray him as some sort of immediate 
            threat to US interests are that he has slaughtered his own people 
            (yes, with US backing), that he has attacked his neighbors (yes, with 
            US encouragement), that he has developed weapons of mass destruction 
            (probably, and what makes his any more threatening than those of any 
            other country, including the US?), that he unstable and possibly insane 
            (no evidence), and that he supports worldwide terrorism (no evidence).</p>
          <p>More to the point, President Bush has complained that Saddam &quot;tried 
            to kill my dad.&quot; Perhaps -- and of course I'm glad he didn't 
            succeed -- but who could blame him for trying, after being tricked 
            into a war which killed hundreds of thousands of Iraqis at the time 
            and hundreds of thousands since, with idiotic sanctions supposedly 
            intended to punish and oust Saddam, but which have only strengthened 
            him and certainly not deprived him of one calorie of nourishment nor 
            one iota of personal comfort.</p>
          <p>I don't blame Mr. Bush for personally wishing to complete the job 
            his father left undone (as he probably views it) and to avenge the 
            attempt on his father's life, but the fact that he and his administration 
            (consisting almost entirely, as you point out, of &quot;chicken hawks&quot; 
            who were too busy or important to serve in the military themselves), 
            have been able to sell the American public on sacrificing a hundred 
            billion dollars and who-knows-how-many American and Iraqi lives on 
            such a personal vendetta, on such a cowboy adventure, is the sad part 
            of this story. Are people that bored and gullible? Evidently so.</p>
          <p>Of course the thing that makes Saddam the focus of so much wrath, 
            so enthusiastically joined by the more impressionable and trusting 
            members of the American public, is that he is sitting atop the world's 
            largest remaining reserves of crude oil. The administration has openly 
            admitted its designs on this oil, without significantly damaging its 
            case and its credibility with its more worshipful supporters in the 
            American public. A public who would, in fact, probably support invading 
            Iraq simply and honestly to secure a few more years worth of fuel 
            for their cars, if the question were put more directly. But we maintain 
            this pretense of self-righteousness, self-defense, etc., because it 
            better fits our self-image.</p>
          <p>As for the practicalities, it seems obvious that a dictator simply 
            sitting on a probable store of hideous chemical and biological weapons 
            is less threatening than a dictator with his back to the wall, under 
            military assault, likely to discharge these grisly weapons on advancing 
            American troops, tens of thousand of whom are already suffering from 
            the effects of these weapons in the last Gulf war, and probably from 
            the effects of American DU (depleted uranium) anti-tank rounds as 
            well. Certainly the U.N. should strongly assert its right to inspect 
            and destroy these weapons, as agreed under terms of the Iraqi surrender, 
            but how does this translate into America getting itself whipped up 
            for an immediate, urgent, full-scale war, with all the tragedy, horror 
            and phenomenal expense which inevitably attend?</p>
          <p>I don’t want to entirely blame the American public for their gullibility 
            in this, without pointing to the two factors which strongly enable 
            this perversity: </p>
          <p>First, a rabidly right-wing punditry, most notably on television 
            and particularly on radio, who have succeeded in dominating the debate 
            in those arenas and convincing large segments of the public that anyone 
            (including journalists and news media) who doesn't back the president 
            in this and other matters is <em>a priori</em> an anti-American, a 
            socialist, or both. When you've got your opponents so successfully 
            painted as ignorant traitors, as agents of numerous evil hidden agendas, 
            dialogue is impossible and alternative sources of news and opinion 
            are so threatening as to be avoided.</p>
          <p>And certainly this president himself is an ideologue who generally 
            admits no input beyond his own corporate and theological underpinnings. 
            Although he occasionally consents to listen in that pained, bored 
            sort of way when appearances require it, he largely shares this us-against-them 
            attitude about people who might potentially give him some valuable 
            input.</p>
          <p>The second &quot;enabling factor&quot; is a press corps largely unwilling 
            to question the inconsistencies and nonsensical pronouncements of 
            public officials, to ask the many obvious unanswered questions. But 
            would you, as a reporter, wish to lose your access to the highly-placed 
            source and the occasional, usually anonymous and self-serving comment, 
            by being a pain in the ass? Would you risk offending a reader or viewer 
            who you and your boss have been convinced is unquestioningly in support 
            of the administration and its conservative, pro-corporate agenda? 
          </p>
          <p>Would you, in other words, be willing to risk your job as a journalist 
            by acting as a journalist is supposed to act, has the <em>obligation 
            and privilege</em> to act? Or perhaps we incorrectly assume the press 
            corps consists of people any more discerning and curious and intelligent 
            than the average person in the first place. </p>
          <p>Finally, the public themselves: Lavishly entertained but intellectually 
            emasculated and powerless, they have sadly been convinced that this 
            administration, composed largely of corporate CEOs and lobbyists, 
            every day actively cutting labor and environmental and consumer safeguards 
            and rights, flaunting American and international law, supporting a 
            minimum wage that ensures that a family lives below the officially-defined 
            poverty level, having taken us from a substantial budget surplus to 
            a huge deficit in only two years and likely to double that deficit, 
            attending unfailingly to the needs of their corporate partners and 
            little else -- that these Keystone cops who have mangled almost everything 
            they've touched and driven the American economy into the ground, are 
            still somehow the knights in shining armor, the rescuers of American 
            family, economy and culture! It is a modern miracle of media manipulation 
            of which Joseph Goebbels would have been envious.</p>
          <p>When a German official, in a moment of candor, compares this administration's 
            attempt to use a foreign war to divert attention from its domestic 
            failings, to the efforts of Hitler to do the same, it is greeted by 
            shock, outrage and &quot;incomprehension&quot; by the administration. 
            Sadly, those protestations are probably sincere. Hitler, at least, 
            was conscious of his manipulations. The current crew is less introspective 
            and more self-righteous, and probably unaware of what they are doing 
            to ensure their own grasp on power.</p>
          <p>Nor do I see much hope for improvement. We are talking, after all, 
            about a public who is unruffled by revelations that they were suckered 
            into the Gulf War by images of Iraqi soldiers ripping babies from 
            incubators and by alleged satellite photos of Iraqi troops massing 
            on the Kuwaiti border -- images <em>entirely manufactured</em> for 
            public consumption by a P.R. firm! And that they are being suckered 
            into a hundred-billion-dollar &quot;Star Wars&quot; program by rigged 
            missile tests. And that war games handily won by a clever, low-tech 
            general are ignored as though they never happened, by a military who 
            wishes to believe that their high-tech approach will always win. </p>
          <p>A public who doesn't care about being so manipulated, then or now, 
            by numerous other &quot;Gulf of Tonkin&quot; manufactured events with 
            most serious and tragic global consequences, I call powerless and 
            emasculated. This is a public who sees no problem with being governed 
            by a congress which grants themselves the most lavish health care 
            and retirement system imaginable, while largely letting the peasants 
            drown when it comes to these matters. A public who largely does not 
            understand the simple sixth-grade concept that legal safeguards which 
            protect the rights of alleged terrorists, also protect <em>themselves</em> 
            if wrongly accused.</p>
          <p>And what does this tell you: A senate hopeful in New Mexico announces 
            that in the past five years her long-entrenched opponent has voted 
            consistently to keep the minimum wage at poverty level, while in the 
            same period raising his own salary by over 300 per cent! My reports 
            are that this remarkable example of hypocrisy has gotten little press, 
            and even less interest from voters. Do you wonder that I have a pessimistic 
            view of a public so accustomed to taking what gruel they are given, 
            led by a disingenuous administration with an uncommon level of media 
            savvy?</p>
          <p>My only consolation, my only glimmer of hope, is that the American 
            people -- albeit by a very tiny margin -- did not actually vote this 
            crew into office. May we survive them to see a better day!</p>
          <p>My love to you and to your mother.<br>
