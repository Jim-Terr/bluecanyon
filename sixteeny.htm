            Pete Domenici, a long-serving New Mexico Republican, announced on 
            Thursday <br>
            he will not run for re-election next year, saying he has a degenerative

            finance.<br>

          FE <i>NEW MEXICAN</i>, OCTOBER 14, 2007</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Senator Domenici 
          has a chance to make a profound and impactful statement by what he chooses 
          to do with the estimated two million dollars in campaign contributions 
          he will not be using for their intended purpose. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As I suspect Senator 
          Domenici would admit, if pressed, our current system of big-money donors 
          and lobbyists perverts representative democracy by giving undue attention 
          to the needs of Industry, at the expense of "us", who are unable to 
          compete with those contributions, junkets, etc. And it distracts candidates 
          and incumbents' energy and attention from governing and addressing the 
          serious questions before us. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Senator Domenici 
          could legally contribute his campaign funds to charity, and there are 
          several public interest groups working to educate the public and to 
          implement public campaign financing. Think of it: for six dollars per 
          citizen, we could replace the contributions of Big Oil, Big Pharma, 
          Big Tobacco, Big Arms Manufacturing, and all the other Big Lobbyists, 
          and perhaps get our government back! </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Anyone who doesn't 
          think that special interest legislation passed recently for Big Pharma 
          alone has cost each of us more than six dollars, hasn't done the math. 
          I could gladly be assessed six dollars -- or twenty or whatever -- to 
          get rid of this absurd cancer on our government. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Reviews on Senator 
          Domenici's legacy are mixed, but this gesture would make even a skeptic 
          like me think kindly of the retiring senator.</font></p>
