        TEDDY:&nbsp;&nbsp; Las Vegas, 1898. The grandest  town in the southwest. This is long before the name &ldquo;Las Vegas&rdquo; came to be  associated with gaming tables. There was plenty of gambling, though, and plenty  of desperate men willing to shoot each other when things didn&rsquo;t go their way &ndash;  and they often did. In fact several historians have written about the  extraordinary level of violence &ndash; and hangings &ndash; in Vegas in the 1880s. Far  beyond those of Deadwood, Tombstone, Dodge City, Kansas, and the towns more  famous for violence in the popular western literature.<br />
  <br />
        But let&rsquo;s look at the lighter side. Its local college was considered the  Harvard of the Southwest, it was a haven for Opera, with a mighty opera house, theater,  churches, a considerable synagogue, an electric trolley car system, telephone  service,&nbsp; a tremendous roundhouse for servicing  the many locomotives that came though. Fraternal organizations and sanitaria of  all sorts, and the first million dollar hotel in the west, built at the  beautiful hot springs near town.&nbsp;  Presidents and dignitaries visited there, and slept there. <br />
  <br />
        This was before it became a capital for filming western movies, because of  course movies had barely been invented then. <br />
  <br />
        Fly-fishing in the mountain streams, riding and hunting in the mountains, and a  grand system of cutting and conveying huge blocks of ice from those cold  mountains to the railroad system that came through, to cool the passengers and  the hotels along the rail line, including a couple of grand hotels in the town  itself.</p>
        <p>I&rsquo;m speaking of course of Las Vegas, New  Mexico.&nbsp; Yes, New Mexico&hellip; no, no, that  other one was no more than a tiny watering hole in the Nevada desert at the  time, unknown to most of America.&nbsp; <br />
          <br />
          Las Vegas New Mexico was one of the grandest &ndash; and rowdiest towns &ndash; in the  southwest.&nbsp; The cattle ranching trade was  in decline at the time, due to a change in which railroads took beef to market,  and that made Las Vegas a perfect place for me to recruit the exceptionally  tough, rough-riding cowboys I needed for a little expedition to Cuba. <br />
          <br />
      Yes, Cuba. The Spanish had it under their thumb in 1898 and I wasn&rsquo;t going to  stand for it, as Naval Secretary of the United States &ndash; at the time. If it was  going to take a little war to kick them out, so be it. Plus a little war is a  grand adventure, in my book. My whole life was, and would continue to be, a  grand adventure. This was one of the most interesting chapters. I hope you  enjoy it. </p>        </td>

  <p><strong>TEDDY ROOSEVELT SLEPT HERE (Theme) </strong>(TRS)<br />
Jim Terr &copy;2017</p>
  <p>I came here to recruit cuz it&rsquo;s the roughest town in the West.<br />
    Meanest out-of-work cowboys who can ride and shoot the best. <br />
    Gonna make a name for myself and earn my battle star,<br />
    Down there in Havana, which isn&rsquo;t all that far. </p>
  <p>I&rsquo;ll call us the Range Rovers&hellip;  make that Rough Riders on second thought. <br />
    History will tell we won every battle that we fought. <br />
    And a hundred years from now some local booster or sloganeer <br />
    Will bring in tourists by saying &ldquo;Teddy Roosevelt, Slept Here.&rdquo;<br />
    <br />
    (CHORUS)<br />
    <em>Yes I put my pants on just like every man who comes your way.<br />
    But unlike them I read maybe two or three books a day.<br />
    And at the end of that day I rest my weary head for a very short while. <br />
    So just say &ldquo;Teddy slept here&rdquo; &ndash; that never goes out of style. </em></p>
  <p>(Group repeat, while modulating key up):<br />
    &ldquo;Teddy Roosevelt, Slept Here!&rdquo;<br />
    &ldquo;Teddy Roosevelt, Slept Here!&rdquo;<br />
    &ldquo;Teddy Roosevelt, Slept Herrrrree&hellip;&rdquo; -</p>
  <p>So if I can lend a little shine to this bustling (raucous? Wild?) little town,<br />
    In case things ever get sleepy here, if the tourist trade slows down, <br />
    Just tell the world that I, a household name by then most surely, <br />
    Was here with cowboys Clinton, Jethro, Leftie, Jack and Curly.  (they each say, in vid.)</p>
  <p>CHORUS TWO:<br />
    <em>Yes I put my pants on just like every man who comes your way.<br />
    But unlike them I read at least two or three good books a day.<br />
    And when night time falls  I rest my weary head for a very short while. <br />
    So say &ldquo;Teddy Roosevelt slept here&rdquo; &ndash; that never goes out of style.</em></p>

    <strong>MAN OF  ACTION</strong> (TRS)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Jim Terr &copy; 2017<br />
<br />
I grew up red and scrawny, as you&rsquo;ve probably heard by now. <br />
Gasping for breath, on the edge of death, allergic to grass and cow. <br />
Survived by determination, no more and, friends, no less. <br />
Said if I&rsquo;m gonna live at all, I might as well be the best.<br />
<br />
<em>(&ldquo;He might as well be the best&rdquo;)**</em><br />
<br />
Some men who got a better start lie under the apple tree,<br />
Enjoying the summer sunshine. No that would not be me. <br />
I lifted bales and ran for miles to strengthen my modest frame. <br />
A man of iron is the only man who&rsquo;s worthy of the name. <br />
<em>(&ldquo;He&rsquo;s worthy of the  name! &hellip; Man! &hellip; Of Iron!&rdquo;)</em></p>
  <p><em>So  when I die leave me by the road, or toss me in the sea. <br />
    Where I lie when it comes my time, it matters not to me. <br />
    But while I live no nag I&rsquo;ll ride, put me on a mighty steed. <br />
    For I am a man of action, yes I am a man of deed. <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (&ldquo;Yes he&rsquo;s a man of deed&rdquo;)</em><br />
  <br />
    Yes give me battles to be won, and rivers to be tamed. <br />
    There&rsquo;s plenty of time for rest when I have lain down in my grave. <br />
    Battles bold and glorious, with peril all around. <br />
    That is where I wish to stand til you lay me in the ground. <br />
  <em>(Group  chorus):<br />
  <br />
  &ldquo;So when he dies we&rsquo;ll say goodbye to our beloved Teddy Bear. <br />
    With backbone straight and legacy great as he lies so peaceful there. <br />
    He scarcely spent a moment, in anything but the lead. <br />
    For he was a man of action, a man of forceful deed.&rdquo;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (&ldquo;yes indeed a man of deed&rdquo;)</em><br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;  Teddy, wistfully / wearily:&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes,  a man of.. but you know, <br />
  of course I do need to rest every now and&hellip;&rdquo; <br />
  (falls  asleep, dreams) (song about taking it easy..)<br />
  <br />
    **<em>This is a sort of &ldquo;Gilbert and  Sullivan&rdquo;&ndash;type men&rsquo;s chorus that comes in occasionally</em><br />

        <br />
            <em>(setup:&nbsp; Teddy and the Roughriders are camping out at  Lincoln Park, a beautiful spot in Las Vegas NM surrounded by some of the best  &ldquo;Railroad&rdquo; homes. First verse or two is sung by a <strong>wealthy robber baron-type  local citizen</strong>, walking along with his little Chow-Chow and singing to himself  about how he doesn&rsquo;t have to say hello to ragamuffins. Later, Teddy turns the  tables on him):<br />
            <br />
            </em><br />
        As I venture out this morning, this fine September day.<br />
        I celebrate my freedom to proceed along my way<br />
        In solitude, except as I may wish to greet a man. <br />
        And then, only such a one as has some silk gloves in his hands. <br />
  <br />
  <em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  (someone passes and says &ldquo;Good day, sir&rdquo;, and he snorts)</em><br />
  <br />
        I clawed my way up to the top of fine society,<br />
        And peer from there at the world below, my wife, my Chow and me.&nbsp; <br />
        Whate&rsquo;er I wish at my command, a gentle peace inside. <br />
        Secure in God&rsquo;s great wish that my good fortune I&rsquo;ll abide.<br />
  <br />
  <em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  (someone passes and says &ldquo;Good morning&rdquo;, and he barely, resentfully,  nods)</em><br />
        I shall not stoop to any man,  though etiquette dictate<br />
        That I should bid &ldquo;Good morning&rdquo; or &ldquo;Good day&rsquo; at any rate. <br />
        Most all do call me master, sure none do call me slave, <br />
        And I will have no senseless talk like &ldquo;Good morning&rdquo; and &ldquo;Good day.&rdquo;</p>
        <p><br />
          <em>(Toward him on the  sidewalk comes Teddy Roosevelt, accompanied by several men including the two  men he previously ignored, who seem to indicate this to Roosevelt. He almost  obsequiously says &ldquo;Good morning, General Roosevelt. A fine good day, is it  not?&rdquo; Roosevelt ignores him, and sings to his guys):</em></p>
        <p><br />
          I too think I&rsquo;ve attained a height by adventures brave and  grand. <br />
          I&rsquo;ve camped out in the dirt and shared poor food with all my men.<br />
          I&rsquo;ve wrestled them there on the ground with no shirt on my chest<br />
          And gracefully surrendered when they got of me the best.</p>
        <p>So I have no use for grandees better than their  fellow man. <br />
          Only in matters (in cause)of highest state would&nbsp; I shake their tender hand. <br />
A throne imagined above the rest is vanity quite depraved. <br />
So with extra special pleasure I decline to say &ldquo;Good day.&rdquo;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>(his men laugh and sing):</em><br />
<em>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not too grand to be our man and he  declines to say GOOD DAY.&rdquo; (laugh more)</em> </p>

      <p><strong>IT KILLS ME  TO KILL A SPIDER</strong> (TRS)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Jim Terr &copy; 2017<br />
<br />
I can send great fleets to conquer worlds across the sea. <br />
If a thousand men are drowned thereby it matters not to me. <br />
I&rsquo;ll charge up hills with rapier raised to run some rascals through <br />
With gushing &nbsp;blood to add some pink to  the lovely morning dew. <br />
<br />
But few men know my softer side, that wishes tiny lambs<br />
And&nbsp; kittens and puppies to quiver gently  in my calloused hands. <br />
With my children all around me, learning of tender touch. <br />
Deep in my heart I know that nothing matters quite as much.</p>
      <p><em><br />
        Yes, I can send a mighty rocket  arcing through the air<br />
        To utterly destroy what heathen soldiers may be there. <br />
        But still I have a tender heart with some tender things inside her.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
        And though sometimes it be needed, still, it kills me to kill a spider.</em></p>
      <p><br />
        A tender soul &nbsp;has no  place on the bloody battlefield<br />
        Where all that counts is the hundreds or the thousands to be killed. <br />
        A weak commander I would be if I had the least concern <br />
        For the agony and death I caused for those I wound and burn. </p>
      <p><br />
        <em>Yes, I can launch a mighty rocket  racing through the air<br />
        To utterly destroy what heathen soldiers may be there. <br />
        But I too have a tender heart with some tender moods inside her.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
        Though sometimes it be needed, still, it kills me to kill a spider.</em><br />
        <br />
      (<strong>NOTE</strong>: I may have to reconsider this song or re-frame it, since Teddy didn't really mind killing spiders or any other animal, thousands of which he mounted and/or stuffed) </p>

          <strong>THE  IMMIGRANT SONG </strong>&ndash;TRS - dt <br />
        Jim Terr &copy; 2017&nbsp; (in &ldquo;Johnny  Horton through History&rdquo; style)</p>
      <p>Well they burned our homes and  wagons,<br />
        And our&nbsp;kids if you must know.<br />
        And they said if you have had  enough,<br />
        Well you are free to go. (Now&hellip;?)</p>
      <p>They were glad when we departed,<br />
        All we had under our arms,<br />
        Then they took our cows and  chickens,<br />
        From our tiny little farms.</p>
      <p><em>CHORUS:</em><br />
          <em>We arrived here in America</em><br />
          <em>And we made this country great.</em><br />
          <em>And now that it is perfect,</em><br />
          <em>Immigrants please go away.</em><br />
          <em>Yes please just go away.</em></p>
      <p>Yes they called us scum and vermin,<br />
        Kept us down when we got here.<br />
        Tried to make sure we were squirmin<br />
        But we overcame our fear.</p>

&quot;Unique, talented, one-of-a-kind.&quot; <strong>-Tom T. Hall</strong></p>
      <p>&quot;Jim  Terr is a very talented singer/writer&nbsp;and I hope you enjoy his songs as  much as I do.&quot;&nbsp;<br />
          <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp;Bobby Braddock</strong>&nbsp;(writer of some  of the most popular songs in the history of country music, such as <em>&quot;He Stopped Loving Her Today,&quot;  &quot;Golden Ring,&quot; &quot;Something to Brag  About,&quot;D-I-V-O-R-C-E&quot;, &quot;We're Not the Jet Set,&quot; &quot;Old  Flames Have New Names&quot;, &quot;Let's Talk About Me</em>&quot;,&nbsp;many  others.</p>
      <p>&quot;A  prolific creator of original wit and music, with a dedicated following on the  internet, his discovery is still shamefully overlooked by the entertainment  industry.&quot;&nbsp;<br />
          <strong>-Tony Byworth</strong>, UK journalist and  author, co-editor of <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>the  BILLBOARD ENCYCLOPEDIA OF COUNTRY MUSIC.</strong></p>
      <p>&hellip;[Jim  Terr has been] described as a modern day&nbsp;Mark Twain, Will Rogers, Jimmie  Rodgers&nbsp;and&nbsp;Jackie Mason&nbsp;rolled into one. Can I add to that list  names <strong>like&nbsp;Shel Silverstein, Tom T.  Hall, Bobby Bare, Ray Stevens</strong>&nbsp;and the likes-- master wordsmiths all,  and country boys too&hellip;<br />

      <p><strong>Jim Marshall, British  Country Music Bulletin</strong>:<br />
  &nbsp;  &nbsp; An entertaining, description-defying collection... If one were to invite  comparisons, you'd perhaps liken Jim Terr to&nbsp;<strong>Tom T. Hall</strong>, or, perhaps&nbsp;<strong>Paul  Craft.</strong></p>
