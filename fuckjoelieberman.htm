    <tr> 
      <td> 
        <blockquote>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Dear Senator Lieberman, 
            </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Congratulations! 
            You got away with it! So despite having supported and endorsed the 
            Republican candidate for president -- and going so far as to question 
            the patriotism of the Democratic nominee -- you've managed to keep 
            your chairmanship. By rights, you should've been summarily ejector-seated 
            from your committees, bonked on the head with your gavels -- cartoon-style 
            -- and hauled from the Democratic caucus naked and on a rail whilst 
            being pelted with wadded-up copies of your RNC address. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">The aforementioned 
            reasons for this still-lenient serving of justice fails to include 
            the syllabus of other trespasses against you, including, first and 
            foremost, your unwavering support for the Bush administration's unforgivable 
            foreign policy -- a policy which has all but bankrupted our treasury 
            and besmirched America's reputation abroad. Heckuva job, Senator! 
            </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">One might be inclined 
            to consider your conduct to date as somehow principled -- even mavericky, 
            had it not been so transparently self-serving. Your behavior has been 
            that of a man guided by nothing more than petty vengeance and retribution 
            -- attention-starved opportunism not unlike grade-school instigators 
            and gossip-mongers whose only path to relevance is to play two friends 
            against each other. Worming your way from side to side depending on 
            which kid or clique likes you more. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Now, I completely 
            understand the political reasons for why President-elect Obama and 
            the caucus ultimately chose to keep you around. Unfortunately, the 
            Democrats need your stinky vote -- such as it is -- in order to theoretically 
            break any future Republican filibusters. And there will be many of 
            those to be sure. However, the closer we get to 60 votes in the caucus 
            the better our chances of reversing the craptastical policies and 
            legislation of your favorite Bush administration and the formerly 
            Republican Congress. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Sure, there's 
            no guarantee that you'll vote with the caucus, but you made it clear 
            that you would have pitched a spasmodic, petulant fit and changed 
            your affiliation to the Republican Party from the "Lieberman Loves 
            Lieberman" party or whatever the hell it's called, had you been stripped 
            of your chairmanship. Consequently, the Democratic caucus would've 
            definitely lost your vote. It's an unenviable "possibly" versus "definitely" 
            proposition. And with the caucus being this close to 60 against what 
            will surely be an obstructionist Republican caucus, we have no other 
            choice but to roll the dice with "possibly." </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">That is until 
            2010 when the Democrats will hopefully attain enough members, and 
            thus votes, that they won't need your support anymore. Then you can 
            storm off and mind-screw the Republicans for a couple of years until 
            -- and it's probably not good strategy to tip our hand like this, 
            but you know it's coming -- until you lose in 2012. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Nevertheless, 
            you got what you wanted yesterday. Circumstances allowed you to keep 
            your chairmanship irrespective of your weasely and contemptible maneuvering. 
            And more than a few of us on the left actually agree with you for 
            once: you managed to abscond off without adequate punishment. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">You got away with 
            it, despite those meddling kids, right? </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Not so fast.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"> I submit to you, 
            Senator Lieberman, that you were punished yesterday more than you 
            realize. Stick with me on this. I'll explain. I've been a supporter 
            of the president-elect for the better part of a year now, and while 
            I've always recognized a deep intellectualism and multilayered thoughtfulness 
            in the man, it never fully occurred to me how he would use these strengths 
            in a position of leadership. Until this week.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"> In sharp contrast 
            to your behavior, President-elect Obama hasn't shown any predilection 
            for pettiness or disloyalty, nor has he undermined his allies for 
            the sake of political expedience. He's proved himself to be a man 
            of great character. Of values. I don't need to remind anyone how he 
            stood by Jeremiah Wright, for example, and at his own political peril 
            when most would've tossed him overboard like political chum. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">You, on the other 
            hand, have shown an unapologetic contempt for the party that once 
            nominated you for the vice presidency -- the party that welcomed you 
            back to the fold even though you slipped through the system and defeated 
            the fairly elected Democratic nominee, Ned Lamont, in 2006. You've 
            betrayed your fellow liberals to settle a political score, Senator 
            -- in order to exact some kind of ignoble payback against your former 
            party, against your caucus and against the netroots for merely calling 
            you out on your literal and figurative smooching of the president. 
            </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">This is behavior 
            President-elect Obama doesn't appear to be capable of. Because he's 
            clearly better than you. In fact, it's not difficult to hypothesize 
            that had you possessed a fraction of his political instincts or any 
            small measure of his morality, you would absolutely not be in this 
            position, Senator. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">See, by allowing 
            you to keep your precious chairmanship -- by letting you off the hook 
            -- President-elect Obama, through his political bigness, punished 
            you without punishing you. He beat you yesterday, Senator. He beat 
            you because he let you be you, and underscored it with his demonstrably 
            better angels and strength of character. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">In the final analysis, 
            the hard reality is that by not choosing retribution, he made you 
            look... ...small. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">And that, Senator, 
            is good enough for me. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Cheers! Bob Cesca
