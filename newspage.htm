        Tuesday, <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;October 
        28, 2008</font></i> (<a href="http://www.abqjournal.com">Albuquerque Journal</a>)</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Democratic 
        supporters of Rick Lass, the Green Party nominee for northern New Mexico's 
        Public Regulation Commission seat, have released two Internet videos using 
        satire — and old music — to go after Democratic candidate Jerome Block 
        Jr.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “When the clock strikes one, two o'clock, 
        there's gonna be another scandal from Jerome Block,” sings Santa Fe performer 
        <font color="#CC0066">Jim Terr</font> to the tune of Bill Haley's old 
        rock 'n' roll hit, “Rock Around the Clock.” <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As headlines from newspaper articles about 
        Block go by on the screen, Terr sings about Block “paying some band that 
        hadn't really shown” — a reference to Block misreporting a $2,500 campaign 
        payment to country-western group that includes San Miguel County Clerk 
        Paul Maez (the county's top election official) for a campaign rally performance 
        that never took place. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Falsified payments, fake reports, around 
        these parts that's all in sport,” Terr sings. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Block and his campaign spokesman did not 
        return calls and an e-mail from the Journal seeking reaction. The ads 
        by Democrats for Lass are the first video salvos of the increasingly high-profile 
        PRC race. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Secretary of State's Office has proposed 
        that Block pay $11,000 in fines and return $10,000 in taxpayer-financed 
        public campaign money for violation of campaign finance rules. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second ad uses the old Brenda Lee hit 
        “I'm Sorry” as a soundtrack as various people — including former state 
        Democratic Party chairman Earl Potter and former long-time Democratic 
        state Rep. Max Coll of Santa Fe — say that they are “sorry” but that they 
        support the Green Party's Lass over Democrat Block. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bernie Logue Y Perea, who organized the 
        Democrats For Rick Lass PAC, said he, Potter and Terr wanted go after 
        Block “in a fun way” with the videos. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Block has accused Democrats for Lass of 
        violating campaign finance laws because of contributions of as much as 
        $2,000 that were made to the PAC. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Block cited a state statute that limits 
        candidates from accepting more than $500 from a “person.” But Potter has 
        noted the PAC is not bound by the same rules as a candidate. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The PAC's videos have been posted on YouTube 
        and on the Democrats for Lass Web site, <a href="http://www.dems4lass.com">dems4lass.com</a>
