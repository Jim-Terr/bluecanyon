          <p class="style62">Republican National Committee chairman Ed Gillespie described the
            ad as “not only grossly unfair, but likely to create a negative backlash
            by mocking a president whom most Americans respect, even if grudgingly
            in some cases, for his clear devotion to their welfare. We all expect
            a certain amount of crassness in the current political climate, but
            this is going too far.” </p>
          <p class="style62">Conservative radio hosts Sean Hannity and Michael Reagan used oddly
            similar language to describe the ad, both denouncing it as “a cruel
            and tasteless parody” of “a president clearly doing his best.” </p>
          <p class="style62">The ad was reportedly an unauthorized “back-room,” after-hours
            effort by interns at a respected political consulting firm reportedly
            paid top dollar by advocacy and media groups such as MoveOn.org,
            ACT (America Coming Together), The Media Fund and even the Kerry
            campaign itself. <span class="style62">
          </span>
          </p>
          <p class="style62">Speaking from one of three hot tubs in his palatial
            home overlooking trendy Hyde Park Road outside Santa Fe, New Mexico,
            consultant Jim Terr said that the parody ad “evidently cuts too close
            to reality, that's why it's making them so crazy. Even though this
            was done independently by some of our interns, on their own time,
            and got loose on the Internet without our approval, I must say it's
            quite good. The way it lampoons the president's <i>‘Papa-will-protect-you'</i> routine – the
            warm, fuzzy version versus the tough-guy version -- even the soothing,
            sappy music. It's subtle, <i>too </i> subtle I would have said,
            but it really works.” </p>
          <p class="style62">Terr questioned the mysterious, crudely inserted reference to picking
            up children on September 11. “What children?” Terr asks. “That's
            a cheap shot, something even Bush wouldn't say. I'd give them a demerit
            for that, but otherwise it's almost perfect. As comedy, that is.” </p>
          <p class="style62">“But who'd consider this anything but straight comedy?” he asked. “Even
            the president isn't that cloying, that phony, that manipulative and
            smarmy in real life. It's clearly exaggerated. And the devoted wife
            sitting quietly next to him, with that pained look of ‘I can't believe
            he's saying this -- what is this, like the 80 th take?' – come on,
            that's so 1950s, isn't it? Who'd think anyone would take this seriously?
            Aren't people supposed to be a little more sophisticated than that
            nowadays?” </p>
          <p class="style62">But the verisimilitude is actually quite striking in many respects.
            The actor portraying President Bush, an uncanny look-alike and sound-alike
            named Grant Pardue, was spotted for the role by one of the Blue Canyon
            interns while spoofing Bush in a comedy club in Los Angeles. Oddly,
            the 47-year-old actor is in fact a registered Republican who claims
            to support the president. “Sure I support him, but we're all whores
            in this business, and I'm not going to pass up a chance like this
            for some exposure. And I guess it really worked out in this case,
            especially with the publicity my boys at the White House and RNC
            (Republican National Committee) are giving it!” </p>
          <p class="style62">Visits to Blue Canyon website and downloads of the video are reportedly
            approaching 250,000 per day as of the past weekend, and there is
            no word as to whether Administration officials will pursue any sort
            of injunction or libel action, or whether American free speech laws
            would be deemed to apply in this case. </p>
