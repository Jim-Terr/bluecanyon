            I promised you a happy home, on a piece of solid ground<br />
            With no alligators or wild hogs, anywhere to be found. <br />
            No bugs or frogs, no poison snakes, no voodoo folks doin&rsquo; the stomp. <br />
            Don&rsquo;t mean to be harsh about a natch&rsquo;l marsh, but I promised I&rsquo;d drain that  swamp.&nbsp; &ndash;MOD-<br />

            Where good folks can do business with standards pure and high. <br />
            But now you are complaining that the swamp ain&rsquo;t drained quite yet. <br />
            Well, darling have some patience and you&rsquo;ll get, well, what you get. <br />

              I didn&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;d make that swamp a sunny, sandy shore. <br />
              I meant I&rsquo;d can those wimpy monsters who was livin&rsquo; there before. </em><br />

            A fox for every henhouse, two wolves for every sheep. <br />

          <p align="left"><strong>DONNIE AT THE BAT</strong><br />
            &nbsp; &copy; Jim Terr 2017 recitation <br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After&nbsp; &ldquo;Casey at the Bat&rdquo;&nbsp; (with reference to the Reichstag fire)<br />
            <br />
            Mudville was despondent when I came up to bat. <br />
            Its once-great&nbsp; team was down by seven,  if you can imagine that. <br />
            <br />
            The bases loaded, and even if I drove us all right in, <br />
            &lsquo;T&rsquo;was unlikely, there in the bottom of the ninth, that we could win. <br />
            <br />
            So at this crucial juncture, this critical point in time, <br />
            The pitcher threw a fast ball, right toward me it came flyin&rsquo;. <br />
            <br />
            I clobbered it with speed and strength; it echoed through the hills. <br />
            That turnin&rsquo; point when I saved the day, the folks remember still. <br />
            <br />
            For though you may not think four runners eight more points could score, <br />
            Some mighty flames did suddenly from our home team dugout soar. <br />
            <br />
            The crowd, bedazzled by the blaze, scarce noticed how well and fine<br />
            I led my teammates &lsquo;round the bases for &ndash;yes!- a full two times! (a 2nd  time?)<br />
            The umpire tried to protest but I quickly shouted him down.<br />
            Cuz fair or not we needed that win in our sad, (despondent?) town. <br />
            <br />
            Eight runs were scored by four brave players, a welcome victory. <br />
            And no one ever did they know that blaze was set by me. <br />
            &hellip;heh heh&hellip;</p>

            &nbsp;&nbsp; Recitation - parody of old c/w trucker  recitation, &ldquo;Giddyup Go&rdquo;<br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &copy; 2017 Jim Terr</p>
          <p align="left">I remember I used to go with my daddy to the great buildings  he owned, up and down the elevators, callin on the tenants who were late on  their rent or just to see if anyone had brought in any pets or other undeclared  contraband. <br />
              <br />
            I was always excited to go with him, and as we went up in the elevator I&rsquo;d  always say &ldquo;Go 85, Daddy&rdquo; cuz I&rsquo;d want to go all the way to the top, the 85th  floor, and he&rsquo;d say yes we&rsquo;re goin straight to the top, though usually we  didn&rsquo;t. He just liked to hear me say &ldquo;Go 85 Daddy.&rdquo;<br />
              <br />
            Well, not long after that, my daddy disappeared from my life. Mama never said  what happened or where he went, but I grew up with a burnin desire to build my  own tall buildings some day. And eventually I did, and people always wondered  why I&rsquo;d say, as I went up in the elevator, &ldquo;Go 85, Daddy&rdquo;, &ldquo;Go 85.&rdquo;<br />
              <br />
            Well one day I rode up with my construction crew up to the top of the tallest  building I had built to date, a full 88 floors, and as we were getting out up  at the top, I looked down and saw someone who looked strangely familiar on the  penthouse roof of the tall building next door, there at the rooftop swimming pool.  He had a babe on each arm just like my daddy used to do, and for some reason I  shouted out, at the top of my lungs, &ldquo;Go 85, Daddy!&rdquo;<br />
              <br />
            Well I&rsquo;ll bet you now the rest. I pulled out my binoculars to get a better  look, and I could see my daddy&rsquo;s monogram on the old bathrobe he was still  wearin. I waved at him and yelled out, &ldquo;Daddy, it&rsquo;s your son!&rdquo; I was so excited  to go down and go up and see him again. He waved and said &ldquo;Hi, son, I&rsquo;ll have  my people call your people and set up lunch sometime soon.&rdquo;<br />
              <br />
            I&rsquo;m still waitin&rsquo;, but I&rsquo;m so happy I met up again with the only person who  really understands when I say&hellip; &ldquo;Go 85, Daddy. Go 85.&rdquo;</p>

            Yes, he was my protector, my cop and judge and jury. <br />
            If you looked at me in just the wrong way, he&rsquo;d rip yr throat out in a hurry. <br />
              <br />
            In truth he was a pussy cat, a furry, friendly boy. <br />
            But I learned some crucial lessons from my good old best friend Roy. <br />
              <br />
            Yes, don&rsquo;t wait for that first strong punch, but strike out first yourself. <br />

            I noticed how thin and bony&nbsp;  he really was under all that hair. <br />
            But I remember how, with just a look, he could give anyone a scare. <br />
              <br />
            He&rsquo;s gone now except in spirit, my wiry, fiery boy. <br />

            &nbsp;&nbsp; Jim Terr &copy; 2017&nbsp;&nbsp; bluegrass gospel, perhaps acapella</p>
          <p align="left">One day our chief of maintenance was home sick with the flu.<br />
            My daddy said hey Donnie T, there&rsquo;s something you must do. <br />
            A tenant on the 23rd floor, her toilet&rsquo;s overflowed. <br />
            For all the things we&rsquo;ve done for you, this one we feel we&rsquo;re owed. <br />
              <br />
            I took this step with no complaint, I left our penthouse fair. <br />
            And journeyed down to 23, to fix that toilet there.&nbsp; <br />
            My hands were soiled, my knees were sore, no one to comfort me,<br />
            But somehow I have not forgot that sweet humility. <br />
              <br />
              <em>CH: Lord please when it comes my time, a  coffin made of gol,<br />
              Will not, even I realize, my go-go good life hold. &nbsp;<br />
              When comes my time to leave this world, when Jesus comes for me, <br />
              Lord please won&rsquo;t you lift me up to Floor 23</em>. <br />
              <br />
              <br />
            Because you see &lsquo;twas there I one time tasted mankind&rsquo;s lot.<br />
            I fixed that toilet, if you knew for what pay you&rsquo;d be shocked.<br />
            &lsquo;Twas none but just the satisfaction of a job well done. <br />
            No extra pay for getting that toilet once again to run. </p>
          <p align="left"><em>CH:  But still that moment beckons me and brings me down to earth.<br />
            The one day I felt truly human since my day of birth.<br />
            If e&rsquo;er that feeling comes again I guess that we shall see.&nbsp; <br />
