  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jim Terr &copy; 2012 Blue Canyon Music BMI</p>
        <p class="style3">I &lsquo;member as a 10-year-old the pleasure it would bring<br />
          To climb aboard the Number 9 and make that brass bell ring.<br />
          That old steam engine stood so proud and tall there in the park.<br />
          So what if we climbed up in there and played til almost dark?</p>
        <p><span class="style3">The brakes and levers even then were painted pretty thick.<br />
  You couldn&rsquo;t move a lever, turn a wheel or throw a switch.<br />
          But Lordy what a wonderland of pipes and valves and gears.<br />
          I felt like something special as an Iron Horse engineer.<br />
          <br />
          <em>CHORUS: But now it&rsquo;s sitting idle there  inside a chain link fence.<br />
          I &lsquo;spose that in a world of lawsuits that must make some sense.<br />
    Perhaps a bit more than it should, it causes me such pain:<br />
    That 10-foot iron fence around the train.<br />
          </em><br />
          A kid could fall and break an arm or lose a toe or two<br />
          From playin&rsquo; up there carelessly as kids are prone (bound?) to do.<br />
          But goodness what a way to spend the day and go for miles<br />
          While lookin out that window keepin&rsquo; one eye on the dials.<br />
          <br />
          <br />
          <em>CHORUS 2: It wasn&rsquo;t just that engine that  (defines?) another age.<br />
    My childhood, too, is also of another time and gauge.<br />
    Perhaps a bit more than it should, it causes me such pain:<br />
    That 10-foot iron fence around the train.<br />
    Yeah Lord I hate that fence around the train.</em></span><br />

&nbsp; Jim Terr &copy; 2012 Blue Canyon  Music BMI<br />
<br />
Now they say that there&rsquo;s a reason that grandparents and grandkids<br />
Get along like nobody else does or ever did.<br />
<em>(spoken line): It&rsquo;s just a joke but there  may be some truth in it, you see.</em><br />
The reason being they both share a common enemy!<br />
<br />
But seriously, folks, the truth may be a big bit more profound: <br />
A child comes into this world with sweet love all around,<br />
He loves and trusts cuz everyone is there to fill his needs.<br />
They long to hold him when he cries, nurse him when it&rsquo;s time to feed&nbsp; (modulate)<br />
<br />
And older folks have set aside the battles they once fought.<br />
They&rsquo;re quick to hug and share their love and for<u>give</u> as they&rsquo;ve been  taught.&nbsp; --<br />
But there&rsquo;s) fifty years or so between, where struggle is the game,<br />
Where battles rage on every page and tears and trials reign.<br />
<br />
<em>CHORUS:  I know it wouldn&rsquo;t be natural, but still I wish we could<br />
Just stretch out the start and end of life that seem so good.<br />
Yes I sometimes wish that like a fish you could just jump straight downstream,<br />
Go from young to old and skip the in-between</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(turn-around  and modulate)<br />
<br />
Yes take those early times of trust and curiosity,<br />
Extend them out til maybe 22 or 23.<br />
And stretch back the sweetness of later years where all ya want to do<br />
Is try to share with others whatever good has come to you.<br />
<br />
<em>CHORUS: Like skippin&rsquo; through a magazine  from the front part to the end,<br />
I wish we could &ndash; I s&rsquo;pose we should &ndash; get that goodness back again.<br />
Yeah I wish that like a flying fish I could sail right straight downstream, <br />
Go from young to old and skip the in-between.</em><br />
<em>Yeah,  maybe life could go from mostly red to mostly green,<br />
If we stick with love and skip the in-between. </em></span><br />

You can go back to Hank, the first country star.<br />
But to be really frank, I don&rsquo;t go back that far.<br />
He and Jim Reeves are somewhere deep in my bones&nbsp;&nbsp; --<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -let me tell ya about Haggard--<br />
