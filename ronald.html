              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="style1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Trump&rsquo;s comments outrageous</strong></span><br />
              <br />
              I may be technically an &ldquo;Anglo&rdquo; or &ldquo;gringo&rdquo; in New Mexico, but my people, the Jews,&nbsp; were murdered by the millions during World War II &mdash; and before &mdash; for being &ldquo;outsiders.&rdquo; Whatever our religion and ethnicity, almost all of our ancestors have been demonized and murdered at various times in history, when it suited the demagogues in power to do so.<br />
              It is for this reason that New Mexico natives &mdash; whether they consider themselves &ldquo;Spanish&rdquo; or &ldquo;Mexican&rdquo;&mdash; should be outraged by Donald Trump&rsquo;s remarks, stating that Mexican immigrants are &ldquo;rapists&rdquo; and &ldquo;murderers.&rdquo;<br />
              This form of hate speech, of demonizing people for political gain, is called demagoguery, and it is something we should all fear and condemn. (And no, Fox News watchers, President Obama did NOT say the same thing when he referred to &ldquo;gang-bangers&rdquo; among illegal immigrants). . . .<br />
              The fact that Mr. Trump&rsquo;s poll numbers have gone up since he made this statement and stuck by it for the sake of his egotism and quest for fame, should disturb us all. It means that too many of us accept this sort of demagoguery and demonization.<br />
              To paraphrase the famous Pastor Niem&ouml;ller quote, &ldquo;First they came for the Socialists, and I said nothing. Then they came for the Mexicans and I said nothing&hellip;. Then they came for me, and there was no one left to speak for me.&rdquo;<br />
              Fortunately, all of Trump&rsquo;s fellow GOP candidates have distanced themselves from his remarks. Unfortunately, not all of them as forcefully as has candidate Jeb Bush.<br />
