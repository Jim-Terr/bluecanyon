          <p>Sabine Ulibarri, B-17 (&quot;Flying Fortress&quot;) ball turret gunner</p>
          </u> 
          <p>&#9;I enlisted in the Air Forces...because I was not going to walk 
            in the war, I wasn't going to freeze. I was a ball turret gunner because 
            I was the smallest one in the crew, and it was very cramped in there, 
            even for me. </p>
          <p>&#9;I flew 35 combat missions. There was a custom in the Air Forces 
            that you could pick your last mission. So for my last mission I waited, 
            and I'd go to orientation in the morning. And if it was a risky one 
            I wouldn't fly. And I kept putting it off and putting it off. But 
            in the meantime I was getting more and more stressed, more and more 
            nervous. So finally I said I'll go tomorrow whatever it is. It turned 
            out to be a wicked one...</p>
          <p>&#9;We decided to drop the bombs (from our wounded B-17) in a fancy 
            neighborhood. It is something none of us would think of doing now, 
            but it seemed to be the right thing then. We came upon an avenue of 
            trees where a platoon of German soldiers was marching, and we played 
            our machine guns on them, and I remember I was laughing insanely, 
            because I had the feeling that they were puppets, and that they would 
            fall when I'd cut the strings off. I didn't think of them as people. 
            We never thought we'd make it back to the English channel, it just 
            didn't seem possible. </p>
          <p> &#9;And you know, you think that when the hour of death comes that 
            you get a certain kind of clairvoyance, that maybe you find answers 
            to things, that you're going to think deep, philosophical thoughts. 
            It didn't happen that way at all. I kept thinking of stupid, silly 
            things--a hamburger, a milkshake, a song that was popular--nothing 
            deep, nothing philosophical. Then I heard the most beautiful words 
            in the English language: &quot;Little friend to big friend, don't 
            worry, we'll see you home.&quot; And there were six P-47's, our own 
            fighters, and one of them parked itself on one wingtip, the other 
            one on the other wingtip, and a third one right above us. And the 
            other three went on to tangle with the six Germans that were coming. 
            We never saw that fight, but we owe those guys our lives.</p>
          <p>&#9;But you see I never got to hate the Germans, because I never 
            fought them hand to hand. I never even saw them. I was fighting machines, 
            not people. I abhorred the very idea of human beings killing human 
            beings. I did then and I did now. But there was a wave of patriotism 
            that came upon the American people. It was overwhelming, it absorbed 
            us all. When we came back from the war we were met by parades and 
            banners flying and bands playing, and fireworks. That is an experience 
            that the Viet Nam veterans didn't get, and it was unfair. Because 
            they put their lives on the line just the way we did.</p>
          <p><u>Keith Little, Navajo &quot;Code Talker</u>&quot;</p>
          <p>&#9;It made all of us very mad, very upset, very frustrated that 
            a great country like Japan would do such a thing (attack Pearl Harbor). 
            Some of our friends enlisted in the Marine Corps. We were told that 
            they were the greatest fighting outfit in the world, and you have 
            to be tough and you have to be mean to be a Marine. And some of us, 
            that's what we wanted to do. It was a great challenge to see if we 
            can become a Marine like some of these great big white men, husky 
            white men that put on a uniform and they look tough. We wanted to 
            be like that. </p>
          <p>&#9;I was fifteen years old and it took some very anxious, frustrating 
            time to get to my 17th birthday so I can enlist in the Marine Corps. 
            I was really sorry that I entered the Marine Corps because the training 
            was so tough. They shave your hair off and you can't talk to anybody 
            without saying &quot;sir&quot;, and you were given orders that you 
            gotta carry out. They made you do certain things that were difficult 
            to do but you did it. You learn to like your weapon, treat it as a 
            real good friend of yours, like your wife, your girlfriend.</p>
          <p>&#9;During the course of our training my Drill Instructor asked me 
            if I was an American Indian. I told him I was, and then he says by 
            any chance are you a Navajo? I said yes, I'm a Navajo. Well, he says, 
            the Navajos are needed by the United States Marine Corps for special 
            duty...</p>
          <p>&#9;The commanding officers protected their Code Talkers because 
            they were very important, and they put a guard on them, somebody to 
            stay with this Navajo all the time. And many of them looked like a 
            Japanese, also, could easily be mistaken for an enemy. People made 
            sure that I was in a hole somewhere, guarded, where all possible harm, 
            you try to keep it out of the way because you were needed to send 
            secret messages.</p>
          <p>&#9;When we left the service, entered back into private life, nobody 
            ever mentioned Code Talkers. It wasn't known, nobody was aware of 
            it. The code was never declassified until when the Fourth Marine Division 
            had one of their annual reunions in Chicago, I believe in 1968, the 
            cloak over the code was never lifted until 20, 24 years after the 
            war ended. </p>
          <p><u>Tony Hillerman, infantryman (France</u>)</p>
          <p> &#9;I guess I'd have to say from the beginning I was a war lover. 
            When I was a teenager I was fascinated by the war in Spain between 
            the fascists and the communists, and I could name you all the Italian 
            and German aircraft and tell you how many destroyers the Italian navy 
            had and their armament, I was really interested in military affairs, 
            even when I was a kid. And the second thing that roused your interest 
            was being born and raised way out in the boondocks, in a farming community 
            where I think any sensible person's goal was to get away and see the 
            world, and World War Two offered a chance for that.</p>
          <p>&#9;I was draft-proof because my mother was a widow, I was the only 
            son left to run the farm, my brother being gone. So I had to talk 
            my mother into signing the proper papers to let me go. She did, she 
            was a wise lady and we shut the farm down and auctioned off the horses 
            and the equipment and away I went. </p>
          <p>&#9;I was scared to death they'd get it over with before I got there. 
            So if you love war where do you get the action? You get the action 
            in the infantry, you know, up close and personal. And what a thrill 
            for a kid like me, 18 years old and never out of Pottawatomie County, 
            Oklahoma hardly. The idea, you know, when you're 18, you're absolutely 
            immortal. </p>
          <p>&#9;Being in a foreign country, being in France, being in a real 
            war, it was on a wonderful, beautiful autumn day I saw my first guy 
            killed...</p>
          <p>&#9;I had one clip with four rounds in it left (in my .45) and just 
            as I got to the asphalt, the German coming the other way got to the 
            asphalt. I got there first, I was settled down, I had my pistol out 
            and cocked, and he came scrambling up. It was dark, it was just getting 
            to be good dawn, and there he was with his white stuff on, with a 
            dark background. Some of these things leave absolutely indelible memories. 
            I wasn't a very good pistol shot, but this was almost point-blank, 
            it was about, I'd say, the width of a one-lane asphalt. And I shot 
            low at him, hoping to hit him in the abdomen, and I hit him right 
            in the face, which doesn't say much for my marksmanship, but it knocked 
            him backwards, so one of his feet were on the asphalt. &#9;And here 
            I am, how many years later, more than a half century later and I still 
            remember that as vividly as if it happened yesterday. I always regretted 
            it. Probably some kid, 19, 18 like I was, and now he's dead.</p>
          <p><u>Bob Lawrence, &quot;Tuskeegee Airman</u>&quot;</p>
          <p>&#9;My dad said listen to the news. And the news announcement was 
            that the Air Corps was going to accept colored enlistees for the first 
            time. This whole thing came about from the pressure in the black community 
            and the black press, giving blacks the opportunity to participate 
            in all branches of the military. They took a selected group of 75 
            to go over to Tuskeegee and form the nucleus there, and I was among 
            that first group...</p>
          <p>&#9;There was a range of feelings in that area. One was because of 
            being a black unit in the South, the whites didn't appreciate the 
            fact that we were being trained in--at that time--the elite area of 
            the military, the Air Force, and so there was some resentment on that 
            part. There was resentment on the part of the community there, which 
            they projected onto our instructors, resenting the fact that those 
            guys were out there at the base, teaching those niggers how to fly.</p>
          <p>&#9;But among the group itself there was a different feeling, because 
            we didn't at the time generally feel segregated, but more as a community 
            coming together to do our bit and also to show that we could perform 
            like anyone else. They brought in a group of what we called draftees, 
            and these were the black soldiers, some of them were what we used 
            to call Old Soldiers, who had actually enlisted years ago and had 
            very little or almost no education, and the Army was their life, and 
            they were brought in to do the grunt work while we went to school. 
            They were interspersed in the barracks with us. And we had fellas 
            that would come to you and ask you to read a letter or to read a newspaper 
            or to write a letter for them, and also in many different ways express 
            their pride in the fact that you guys are really going to do something 
            and make history. </p>
          <p>&#9;I was assigned to a fighter group whose primary mission was to 
            protect bombers as they flew on their missions. The bomber groups 
            would refuse to have us escort them, until the war situation got such 
            that they didn't have a choice, and we were given the assignment. 
            We were the only Air Force unit that never lost a bomber to fighters 
            in the whole war. And then the bomb units would ask to have the 332nd, 
            the Red Tails as we were called because of the airplane marking, would 
            ask for us to escort them. </p>
          <p align="left">&#9;Which was great. We had a great camaraderie in the 
            air, but it didn't exist on the ground. Many times they were very 
            cordial and we had good interaction socially, but as soon as we came 
            back to the States after the war, things reverted to the racial attitudes 
            of, well, they were so glad because we had protected them and chased 
            the fighters away, and so we had drinks, we had a jeep to use, anything 
            we wanted, but that was it because they had their girlfriends there 
            (at the Officer's Club) and they didn't want to have anything to do 
            socially with us when we got back to the States. But overseas it was 
            a different situation, it was open arms.</p>
