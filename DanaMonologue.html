          Dana&rsquo;s  death - monologue&hellip;<br />
        </p>
        <p>My youngest sister and I agree it was the worst moment of  our lives. There we were, in the hospital consulting room, with our mom, sharp  but 90 years old and hard of hearing, waiting for the report from the doctor on  our sister, Dana, who had had a brain hemorrhage that afternoon. It was about  10 at night. Being hopeful, idealistic types, both Nancy and I were expecting  some sort of hopeful, positive report. The doctor sat down, looking VERY dour,  and said that Dana&rsquo;s hemorrhage had been massive, and had pushed her brain over  to the side (he demonstrates), and that there was virtually no brain function  left, and wasn&rsquo;t going to be. </p>
        <p>This creates an immediate awareness that you have a couple  simultaneous thought processes going on &ndash; maybe all the time: What you hope and  expect, and what&rsquo;s actually happening. Usually there&rsquo;s some accommodation or  reconciliation between the two, but not this time.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid,&rdquo; the doctor said, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no possibility for  any life here, that she would want, that you would want, that I would want for  myself or anybody in my family.&rdquo; Nancy  sobbed something about whether there wasn&rsquo;t SOME minute chance of some better  outcome, given some time, given some luck, something he could do. The doctor  said no, he could perhaps remove some of her skull to relieve some pressure,  which might prolong her breathing function a little longer, or something, but  that basically she&rsquo;d never even breathe again without a ventilator, that she  not only would never move or speak again, but she probably wasn&rsquo;t even aware.</p>
        <p>My mom was sitting there pretty still, looking pretty  vacant, definitely not hearing any of this, and I took her hand and said to her  in a sort of primal, guttural shout, the only thing that came to mind to say, <em>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no good, Mom!&rdquo;</em>&nbsp; Mom still didn&rsquo;t react much. She still hasn&rsquo;t  reacted, at least not in the way she thinks she should. Four months later now,  she says she still hasn&rsquo;t cried about it, and feels she just doesn&rsquo;t get that  Dana is gone. I think she gets it perfectly well, but has just seen so much  death at her age, seen so many friends go,&nbsp;  that she&rsquo;s got better defenses about it than the rest of us. </p>
        <p>I cried plenty, starting right about then, when I went down  and out into the parking lot, which was thankfully empty of human activity. I  wailed into the darkness, my grief focused on Mom and the legendary pain of  losing a child. I don&rsquo;t doubt that Mom has had plenty of pain, but as I said,  she claims she hasn&rsquo;t cried, hasn&rsquo;t grieved properly, though I&rsquo;m sure she has.</p>
        <p>Back in the hospital, I like to say there was probably never  a more clear-cut, unambiguous case of the patient&rsquo;s wishes being spelled out. Dana  was a nurse, an RN, who had seen it all, and was a hard-nosed type to begin  with, and she had all the Living Will paperwork very much in order, very much  rejecting any so-called heroic measures to keep her alive for this sort of  existence. Her close friend Robert, also a nurse, had grabbed her paperwork  before coming to the hospital. My brother, an attorney, was on the scene, as  were Dana&rsquo;s closest pals, also nurses, at her bedside, completely distraught  but also available to testify as to her wishes if there was any question &ndash;  which there wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
        <p>Her two kids were there to sign off on the proceedings, which  involved &ldquo;harvesting&rdquo; her organs (what a horrible term!) for transplant use, as  she had also clearly specified. This was done the next day, and several weeks  later, the kids received a remarkably detailed and warm letter from the organ  folks explaining exactly to whom all the organs had been given, whose lives  they had saved, etc.</p>
        <p>Mom and I left the hospital that night, to drive home,  rather than follow this whole ritual, for which we weren&rsquo;t needed. The next  morning, back home before this whole final routine at the hospital had unfolded  and before Dana was even officially dead, the visitors started coming by. First  was another of Dana&rsquo;s nurse friends, one of the many she had encouraged and  supported in getting her nursing degree, accompanied by her adorable little  girl, Natalia, maybe four years old.</p>
        <p>Natalia went into the living room to retrieve a couple  stuffed animals that were sitting on the couch, and brought them in to show  &ldquo;Grandma.&rdquo; Grandma was wide-eyed with delight and held Natalia on her lap, sharing  her excitement, as though nothing had happened the night before, for such is  her nature. I got a photo of that moment, which I cherish. <br />
