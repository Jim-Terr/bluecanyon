          <p><strong><font size="5">George W. Bush is not the problem.</font></strong></p>
          <p>George W. Bush is not the problem.</p>
          <p>The audacity of this administration in threatening a &quot;regime 
            change&quot; in Iraq or any other sovereign country it considers evil; 
            the maintenance of the <a href="http://www.d-n-i.net/">most expensive 
            &quot;defense&quot; force in the world</a><em> by far</em><em><font color="#000000" size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">,*</font></em> 
            in the absence of threatening neighbors at or near our borders—these 
            would be unthinkable without the willing acquiescence of an overwhelmingly 
            complaisant and unquestioning Congress and press corps—and public.</p>
          <p>The president's daily clench-jawed, hissing pronouncements about 
            evil in the world and in modern life, backed up by your tax dollars 
            and an ever-tightening view of free speech and civil liberties, would 
            be absurd if not for the fawning millions of &quot;dittoheads&quot; 
            and Christians co-opted by the right wing, and others of potential 
            good will who sadly see this unexceptional good old boy as a clear, 
            bright, trustworthy father figure and savior.</p>
          <p>Those billions of dollars which, as Senator Everett Dirksen once 
            said, start to add up to real money after a while, spent on &quot;Star 
            Wars&quot; instead of something workable and important, such as actual 
            human needs; the unlimited spending and effort put into making the 
            United States the Master of both earth and space—this could be at 
            least the subject of some debate, but the sad fact is that most Americans 
            would probably vote to support the military-industrial-Congressional-administration 
            complex on this question, if it were ever clearly <em>posed</em> as 
            a question.</p>
          <p>(Speaking of being hypnotized by irrelevant questions and news coverage, 
            how is it that Martha Stewart's stock dealings take up so much air 
            time—and even congressional hearings!—when Ken Lay and other corporate 
            bandits wind up with millions of dollars after destroying their companies 
            and their employees' futures?)</p>
          <p>After all, a president who never had the curiosity to travel outside 
            the US until he became president, who (like the vice-president and 
            most of his cabinet) avoided military service and has therefore kept 
            a pure and noble view of warfare and military conquest—this is an 
            uncomplicated leader with an uncompromising world view that simple 
            and accepting people can look up to. </p>
          <p>(The perfect leader for a people who fall for TV spots like the ones 
            running here in New Mexico, asking us to call our Rep. Heather Wilson 
            to thank her for voting for a prescription drug bill so inadequate 
            that Senate Republicans produced their own bill! The spots were sponsored 
            by a group called the &quot;United Seniors Association&quot; [USA 
            - get it?], which turns out to be [surprise!] a <em>pharmaceutical 
            industry front group</em>! But don't get me started on <a href="http://www.prwatch.org">media 
            manipulation</a> and &quot;astroturf&quot; phony grassroots groups 
            and the people who fall for them. Propaganda is a whole 'nother story, 
            albeit the key story of our time...)</p>
          <p>Especially with a War on Terror in progress, and a war on Iraq in 
            the offing, probably before Election Day. Who would abandon their 
            leader in wartime? Certainly not you. Certainly not I. Certainly not 
            <a href="rathernot/index.html">Dan Rather</a>. And <em>certainly </em>not 
            the millions of dittoheads and co-opted Christians who bought into 
            the &quot;culture war&quot; scenario long before it crystallized into 
            a &quot;War on Evil.&quot;</p>
          <p>So 19 assholes pulled off a brilliantly-executed, vicious act of 
            vandalism on September 11. (I'm not interested in their political 
            arguments or gripes; I don't give them credit for anything beyond 
            a rabid, blind fundamentalism). <em>Touch&eacute;</em>! Now what? 
            Presumably their best and brightest were killed in the event, thereby 
            reducing, not increasing, the threat of terrorism. How does this translate 
            into a sudden imminent threat that justifies spending <em>hundreds 
            </em>of billions for every military action and civil liberties infringement 
            that this crackpot administration can dream up? </p>
          <p>How many billions are we willing to spend—are <em>you</em> willing 
            to spend—to prevent one more terrorist act? Two more terrorist acts? 
            Would <em>any </em>amount of money prevent one maniac from <a href="http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/bush/keller.htm">bringing 
            an atomic bomb in a suitcase into New York City</a>? How does the 
            fact that 15 of the 19 terrorists came from Saudi Arabia, translate 
            into an anti-terrorist war on Afghanistan, Iraq, Korea—anywhere but 
            Saudi Arabia? Tracking terrorists is one thing, a needle-in-a-haystack 
            enterprise but a worthy goal; cleansing this huge world of evil is 
            a Roy Rogers fantasy. (Apologies to Roy Rogers!)</p>
          <p>How does the CIA and FBI not being able to co-operate, not being 
            able to &quot;connect the dots&quot;, translate into spending 38 billion 
            dollars (remember? those billions that add up to real money eventually…) 
            to create a new agency to co-ordinate the anti-terrorism efforts that 
            they couldn't handle? May I sell you a large bridge?</p>
          <p>If the $148 billion (my rough estimate) spent so far on the &quot;War 
            on Terrorism&quot; had resulted in, for instance, a reduction of the 
            number of planes wandering over the White House in the past year, 
            I'd be more convinced. (And yes, I'm all for defending the White House 
            and whoever's inside it, even if it means shooting down an airliner 
            or private plane that wanders too close by.) But no one has even been 
            able to manage that so far, yet they (and we) are willing to spend 
            tens of billions on a fanciful but profitable &quot;Star Wars&quot; 
            experiment to shoot down speeding missiles in outer space, and to 
            go along with <a href="http://www.fas.org/spp/starwars/program/news00/000307-nmd-trw.htm">faked 
            tests</a> to justify its continuation. </p>
          <p>By the way, a word about the &quot;co-opted Christians&quot; I've 
            referred to twice already. This is the source of my great sadness 
            in this matter. How did these people of such great good will, with 
            an ostensible desire to make the earth once again a garden, get hoodwinked 
            into backing everything anti-Christian? War, hate, self-righteousness 
            and vindictiveness, destruction of life in all its forms (excepting 
            pre-natal). <em>Can you say Ralph Reed? Can you say <a href="toughtalkradio/index.html">Rush 
            Limbaugh</a>?</em> I'm not the first to observe that Jesus would be 
            weeping right now. If only this tremendous potential for good could 
            be harnessed for something constructive, such as a <a href="http://www.thehungersite.com/cgi-bin/WebObjects/CTDSites.woa/57/wo/m10000BC300St800Ae/1.0.45.1.0.1.0.1.0.CustomContentLinkDisplayComponent.0.0">war 
            on starvation</a> and disease and tyranny. </p>
          <p>What about stillness, gentility, simple fairness, spirit, humility, 
            suffering and <a href="http://blueprint.bluecrossmn.com/topic/brnickel">subsistence</a>, 
            indigenous ways and wisdom? What about <em>Prairie Home Companion</em> 
            and Doc Watson? Do you think any great number of the testosterone-laden 
            men and women in Washington who talk about getting government off 
            your back just enough to con you into letting them pass a few thousand 
            more laws each year to regulate your life and future for seven generations, 
            are primarily concerned with these things?</p>
          <p>Is there anything in the world, from your health to your love life 
            to your imagination to your children to your DNA to the future of 
            entire nations, that the unelected assemblage in the White House wouldn't 
            like to control and commercialize if they could? Is there any activity, 
            from incarceration to education to weapons manufacture, that they 
            don't think could be handled more efficiently and ethically by the 
            private sector? Is there any &quot;white-collar&quot; outrage, such 
            as robbing wage-earners and retirees of their life savings, that they 
            might consider as criminal as a kid holding up a 7-11?</p>
          <p>I was fascinated years ago to observe a dog with one of those huge 
            cones taped on this neck to prevent him scratching his ears, which 
            had just been lopped off by the vet. He was yipping excitedly to see 
            his master, happy to be rescued from this torture, <em>unaware that 
            it was his master who sent him to the vet in the first place! </em></p>
          <p>Why does this remind me of people who voted for a president whose 
            cabinet and whose concerns reflect the interests of oil and commerce 
            and fundamentalism and self-righteousness, rather than any of the 
            values and concerns they would like to see in their children? A president 
            who has appointed wolves (industry executives and lobbyists) to guard 
            the henhouse (us—his employers!) in virtually every area of health, 
            safety, environment, worker and consumer interest? And who unashamedly 
            promises to appoint more of the same, and more Supreme Court judges 
            like the ones he says he admires most—<em>Antonin Scalia and Clarence 
            Thomas!</em></p>
          <p>A president who takes advantage of every possible photo opportunity, 
            whether it's forests or firefighters (always with a huge headline 
            logo in the background to make sure we get the point), with no &quot;journalists&quot; 
            daring to be impolite enough to point out that he's whacked a billion 
            dollars from the firefighting budgets of the Departments of Interior 
            and Agriculture! The &quot;disconnect&quot; between what this man 
            says and what he does is frightening, almost as much as the unwillingness 
            of the press to point it out and the unwillingness of the public to 
            hear it. </p>
          <p>Still, no, George W. Bush isn't the problem. Without us, without 
            our need for simple answers and a seemingly noble leader who can put 
            our many fears to rest, George W. Bush would be just another baseball 
            fan in Texas, choking on pretzels, unknown except as the son of a 
            former president whose &quot;unfinished war&quot; he's now determined 
            to finish—with about 40 more of your billions, with the lives a few 
            hundred thousand more Americans, Iraqis and their children, and against 
            the advice of the leaders of <em>every </em>other nation in the world, 
            who somehow lack his Chauncey Gardner-like insight. </p>

            as well as our virtues. It will bring out the best in some people, 
            while others will make tons of money and/or use the disaster to push 
            forward their moronic over-simplifications. Some will be propelled 
            into a deeper spirituality, while others will take the disaster as 
            confirmation of their pre-existing brutal, self-serving philosophies, 
            or their callow, New Age, self-serving philosophies. Ego will continue 
            to thrive. Crazy people will be made crazier, the weak and poor and 
            voiceless will bear the brunt of the suffering, zealots of various 
            stripes will take the disaster as proof that their historic opposition 
            must be crushed, the real horror and clarity of that day will gradually 
            and then more rapidly be used to move product and perform the subtle 
            mythologizing of advertising, stunted versions of very real virtues 
            (patriotism, heroism) will appear, as will (thankfully) amazing three-dimensional

            Have you ever wondered whether there is any reality to the idea of 
            clairvoyance, of seeing into the future, even on an intuitive level?
