            <strong>LIVING IN AMERICA</strong> - documentary interviews of US &quot;foreigners&quot;<br />
            <em><br />
&quot;Foreign&quot; visitors share what strikes them about the US, what they like,   what could be better. An antidote to &quot;American Exceptionalism&quot;</em><br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Hi,   I&rsquo;m Jim Terr. I&rsquo;ve produced several</strong> documentaries with foundation and   other private funding, which have gotten quite a bit of acclaim and   visibility despite their low budgets. Here's a link to a short video   about THOSE documentaries:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn6sk14VoIg" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn6sk14VoIg</a></p>
          <p>I&rsquo;m   asking your support for a new project which I think would be unusually   valuable at this time, and inexpensive and simple to put together.&nbsp;<br />
              <br />
            It&rsquo;s called&nbsp;<strong>&ldquo;Living in America.&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;My   idea is to collect short interviews with foreigners living in the US,   to get their impressions about living here &ndash; what strikes them as   strange, what is good, what could be done better, compared to where they   are from.&nbsp;<br />
            <br />
            Though I   have a particular interest in issues of health care, public life, civic   life, family life, etc., I&rsquo;m not looking to make any point in   particular, and I&rsquo;m certainly not looking to &quot;run America down.&quot; &nbsp;<br />
            <br />
            I do believe strongly, however, that there is a very odd attitude called&nbsp;<strong>&ldquo;American Exceptionalism&rdquo;,</strong>&nbsp;which   I&rsquo;d like to address simply by making this video. American   Exceptionalism &ndash; or one symptom of it &ndash; is the belief that other   countries&rsquo; experiences, what works there, in life and in politics &ndash; is   irrelevant to us, because the US is so special, Americans are so   different, that human nature and other principles do not apply to us.&nbsp;<br />
            <br />
            Being   geographically isolated and in our own world in many ways, we miss the   foreign, outside perspective, and this video aims to provide that, and   to counteract what I consider the very astounding and dangerous idea   that we have nothing to learn from people who were not raised in the US.&nbsp;<br />
            <br />
            As a video producer, I&rsquo;ve gotten over&nbsp;<strong>750,000 views on YouTube</strong>&nbsp;on my various short videos, and&nbsp;<strong>Google lists over 70,000 citations</strong>&nbsp;of my various projects, so one thing I will say for myself is that my work does get publicized, and get&nbsp;<strong>SEEN</strong>.&nbsp;<br />
            <br />
            And one special thing about this project, the &quot;Living in America&quot; documentary, is that the&nbsp;<strong>cost to produce will be exceptionally low</strong>,   because I will use what I&rsquo;m calling the &ldquo;Crowd-shot&rdquo; technique to   gather footage. That is, rather than traveling around the country to   collect footage, I&rsquo;ll be asking people to SUBMIT short clips of what   they&rsquo;d like to say, what their observations are, and, making sure the   audio and video quality are good, that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ll put together as the   feature-length documentary.&nbsp;<br />
            <br />
            In   this way I think I can do a good-quality documentary, suitable for   broadcast, for theaters perhaps, for public libraries and schools, for   public access channels, for passing around for political discussion   purposes &ndash; for under $10,000.&nbsp;<br />
            <br />
            This   is the first time I&rsquo;ve used Kickstarter to try to raise funding, and   contributions will be repaid with copies of the final DVD to give as   gifts, or to libraries or whomever you choose &ndash; so I think it&rsquo;s a   win-win.** Please pledge to support this project if you can. Thank you.&nbsp;<br />
            <br />
            **   I donate my videos to as many schools and libraries as I can - that's   part of what I do - and if you'd rather I send &quot;your&quot; DVDs to more   schools and libraries, I can do that if you let me know.<br />
