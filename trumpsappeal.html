        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I&rsquo;m Jim Terr, and  I&rsquo;ll be shooting interviews with Trump supporters &ndash; hopefully  around the country &ndash; to be compiled into a 60- or 80-minute  program, consisting only of these videos, with no editorial comment  or commentary. <br/>
          <br/>
          My purpose is to get an idea directly from  Trump supporters, what they like about the guy, what is the appeal.  Because I  - along with many others &ndash; do not get it. That&rsquo;s  right, I&rsquo;m no fan of Mr. Trump, and I make no secret about it. <br/>
          <br/>
          But, this being a serious documentary, done under  foundation funding standards, it will be strictly exploratory, giving  Trump fans a chance to express what the appeal is &ndash; personally,  emotionally, policy-wise, whatever. And again, there will be no  editorializing on my part, no trick questions or ambush questions, no  editing other than for brevity or clarity.<br/>
          <br/>
          I have done  many well-received, foundation-funded educational videos &ndash; you can  read about many of them at <a href="http://www.bluecanyonvideo.com">www.BlueCanyonVideo.com</a> &ndash; and I will  stick to those standards of objectivity.  PLEASE NOTE that I have  conducted MANY video interviews &ndash; from World War Two vets to  Holocaust survivors, to &ldquo;life&rdquo; survivors, with fairness and with  a gift for drawing people out. <br/>
          <br/>
          All I ask of the  interviewees is that you talk about Mr. Trump, what appeals to you  personally about him, and avoid mention of <strong>Obama, Hillary,   Liberals</strong>, etc., and all that comparitive stuff &ndash; we have plenty  other places to discuss that &ndash; just stick with Trump&rsquo;s appeal to YOU.. </p>
        <p><br/>
  If we interview, you&rsquo;ll be asked to sign a release specifying all  this &ndash; including my promise  to not distort or editorialize on what  you say &ndash; and of course understanding that probably not all  interviews will be used. <br/>
  <br/>
  Finally, I would prefer that you  not read a prepared text (notes are OK) &ndash; but rather speak from the heart  please. And I&rsquo;d prefer so-called &ldquo;private citizens&rdquo;, not any  sort of spokesmen, party activists, consultants, bloggers, talk radio hosts,  etc. If that&rsquo;s you, please contact me at the email shown and we can  try to arrange this. <br />
  <br />
  First set of interviews will be <strong>Hawaii</strong> (Oahu and Kauai) in early January. <br />
  <br/>
