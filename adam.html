          STORY:</font></b><font color="#990099"> I once met, at some event or 
          other at the Lensic Theater in Santa Fe, a ~70-yr-old couple from Lubbock, 
          TX, middle-American-looking as can be. </font></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#990099">In 
          the course of conversation, they menitoned that they were active in 
          their local chapter of PFLAG (Parents and Friends of Lesbians and Gays). 
          I asked if they had a gay son or daughter. They (one of them) answered, 
          &quot;No, it's just a justice issue with us.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#990099"> 
          That made a big impression on me..</font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The times they are a-changin', 
            but a little too much for me. <br>
            People tryin' to change my mind about how things oughta be.<br>
            Like just what makes a marriage, and a family that endures. <br>
            I may not know much but there's some things (one thing) I know for 
            sure. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">They can call me some old 
            dinosaur, with a rusted-shut old mind. <br>
            They can say that I'm just old-fashioned, prejudiced and blind. <br>
            But it all comes down to just one thing: who should marry and conceive, 
            <br>
            Yeah I'm sure their names have crossed your path, Adam and Steve. 
            </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Adam & Steve, and their 
            precious little kids <br>
            Tryin' to live their lives upright just like their fathers did. <br>
            You can try to shake my faith, but that's just what I believe, <br>
            Marriage is between two men, like Adam and Steve. </i></font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">They call it cloning now 
            but way back in them Bible days <br>
            Adam's seed and Stephen's weed were mixed on a golden tray, <br>
            Put into a cave to brew with candlelight and prayer.<br>
            DNA it's called today but it's magic I declare. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Adam & Steve, and their 
            precious little kids, <br>
            Never gonna be ashamed 'bout what they went and did. <br>
            Way back there in ancient times, this is how folks did conceive, <br>
            With a little bit from two good men, like Adam - and Steve. </i></font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now some folks want you 
            to accept that a woman and man <br>
            Should get down on all fours and reproduce like two guys can. <br>
            Don't get me wrong, I love those gals but let's keep 'em where they 
            are, <br>
            Huntin' game and cookin' same for us men sittin' 'round the fire. 
            </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So let's try to be tolerant, 
            of the garbage some folks say. <br>
            But don't forget it ain't happened yet cuz it ain't the ancient way. 
            <br>
            If our values ever change that much I'll surely grieve <br>
            For the way of life that made us strong, like Adam and Steve. </font></p>

            you can laugh at God, then friend you're so naïve, <br>
