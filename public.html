    This month's topic: <br>
    <font color="#CC0033">BURST WASHING MACHINE HOSES-- THEY WILL FLOOD YOUR HOME!</font></i></b></FONT></P>
  <P><I> </i> <font size="3">As I mentioned in the e-mail that probably brought 
    you here, a SECOND friend's home in as many years was completely flooded by 
    a washing machine hose that burst while the owners were away for a few hours. 
    Both homes were completely ruined; one was covered by insurance and the other 
    was, effectively, not.*</font></P>
  <P>So I've compiled some information on the subject, from various sources, to 
    inform you and to try to motivate you to inspect and replace your hoses regularly: 
  </P>
  <P>Burst washing machine hoses cause an estimated $150 million in damage per 
    year, in the US and Canada. The most effective way to prevent this is to turn 
    off your water valve(s) when you're not using the washer. At minimum, turn 
    off the valve(s) if you're going to be away for a few days. </P>
  <P>Short of that, you should inspect your hoses regularly for wear, leaks, obstructions 
    and kinks--including the hoses inside the machine, if you can. </P>
  <P>Washing machine hoses cost about $10 or $20 per set. Ask if your insurance 
    company has a program to allow you to purchase new hoses at a reduced price. 
  </P>
  <P>To replace the hoses, turn off the water valve, install the hoses with no 
    kinks or sharp bends, make sure the threads line up properly and are tight, 
    then check for leaks when you turn the water back on. Be sure to leave at 
    least four inches of space between the water connection and the back of the 
    washing machine, to reduce chances of kinking. </P>
  <P>Your plumber can install a "water hammer arrestor" which can absorb the shock 
    of your washing machine valve shutting off, and a single-handed valve that 
    makes it more convenient to turn off the water to the washing machine. </P>
  <P>There are at least two devices, the "Flo Logic" and the "AMI Floodsaver", 
    designed to help reduce the risk of flood damage. I'm trying to get more info 
    on these and should have that info if you request the card below. </P>
  <P><b><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">The Bottom Line: 
    REPLACE THOSE HOSES every year or two, or more often if inspection shows any 
    wear, weakening, bulging or leaks. </font></i></b></P>
