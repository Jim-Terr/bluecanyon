      <p><em><span class="style123">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></em><span class="style123"><strong> Jim Terr </strong>occupies
          a unique place in citizen activism. <br>
          In both his brilliant satire work, and his more serious essays and
          outreach, <br>
          he has a peculiar gift for focusing on the people who need to be
          reached <br>
          and who might be reached, instead of just &#8220;preaching to the
          converted.&#8221;&nbsp; <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His is a unique and valuable gift
          of populism and simplicity,<br>
          perhaps a result of his small-town upbringing. <br>
          <br>
          His work is wise, hard-hitting, unusually effective, and deserves the
          support <br>
          of everyone who wishes for a more humane world. <br>
          Especially in these particularly divisive times, <br>

                  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Las Vegas, NM has been the
                    locale for so many films and<br>
                    TV shows for decades that some degree of<br>
                    &#8220;jadedness&#8221; has reportedly set in among residents<br>
                    asked to participate as background &#8220;extras&#8221; and in<br>
                    other ways.<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But local video producer Jim
                    Terr reports no lack of<br>
                    support for his feature-length film, &#8220;A Chicken in<br>
                    Every Garage,&#8221; currently nearing completion with<br>
                    the recent shooting of the opening scene at Charlie&#8217;s<br>
                    Bakery.<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The film title is a melding of
                    two famous Depression<br>
                    era slogans, &#8220;A Chicken in Every Pot&#8221; and &#8220;A Car in<br>
                    Every Garage.&#8221; The film is based on Terr&#8217;s run in the<br>
                    US Presidential Pre-Primary in Arizona in 2012. (Terr<br>
                    reports that he got 59 votes, &#8220;not the worst showing of<br>
                    all the candidates&#8221;), and that he participated mainly with<br>
                    the making of the current film in mind.<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The film has evolved to
                    include themes of mystery,<br>
                    psychology, and much music -- including by local<br>
                    performers &#8211; and also includes many local scenes<br>
                    and scenery. Terr currently has a campaign<br>
                    on <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/jimterr">www.GoFundMe.com</a>
                    for completion funding &#8211;<br>
                    urgent, he says, since the movie pokes fun at Donald<br>
                    Trump and needs to be released before the November 8<br>
                    election. The film also includes elements of his<br>
                    &#8220;Romaine Fielding at the Plaza Hotel&#8221; series of stories<br>
                    and videos, featured at <a href="http://www.tentaclesfilm.com">www.TentaclesFilm.com</a>
                    .<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opening scene shot at Charlie&#8217;s
                    Spic N Span<br>
                    starred Santa Fe film union head Jon Hendry as a<br>
                    psychiatrist speaking to a local civic club about the<br>
                    story&#8217;s main character, who has been in a coma for<br>
                    years but with very full brain activity, perhaps<br>
                    imaginary and perhaps based on real experience.<br>
                    Hendry also donated t-shirts commemorating Las<br>
                    Vegas&#8217; 100 years of film history, as premiums for<br>
                    those participating in the project.<br>

                    President Trump</strong></span><br>
                <br>
                <br>
                Now that the unthinkable (for me and most of my friends, and the
                pundits) has happened, and after the initial shock, I am seeking
                a few things to be hopeful about in a Trump presidency. <br>
                <br>
                First, I remind myself that before he became a Republican and
                Christian and Conservative a few months ago, he was just a
                playboy Democrat man-about-town businessman. Evidently not a
                great one, judging from his bankruptcy record and presumably
                from his never-to-be-revealed tax returns, but a guy who
                hopefully prefers that he and his buildings survive,
                above-sea-level, &nbsp;in a world of clean air, water and
                livable climate. <br>
                <br>
                So I assume that two-thirds of his bluster and his positions
                were just that, and that he will find a way to walk back much of
                his pro-gun, anti-abortion, jail-Hillary, anti-immigrant,
                pro-right-wing-Supreme-Court rhetoric and be forgiven his
                inconsistency, as he has been so far, by his Faithful. &nbsp;And
                I assume he wouldn&#8217;t like his family (or himself) to become
                victims of gun nuts and vigilantes.<br>
                <br>
                Second, he&#8217;s a self-proclaimed know-it-all, so when he&#8217;s
                confronted with other powerful egos in the GOP establishment I
                fully expect him to say, eventually, &#8220;To Hell with you all,&#8221; and
                do his own thing.<br>
                <br>
                I am looking forward to him having the same experience Barry
                Goldwater had, when he said in 1994,<span class="style163"> <em>&#8220;Mark
                    my word, if and when these preachers get control of the
                    [Republican] party, and they're sure trying to do so, it's
                    going to be a terrible damn problem. Frankly, these people
                    frighten me. Politics and governing demand compromise. But
                    these Christians believe they are acting in the name of God,
                    so they can't and won't compromise. I know, I've tried to
                    deal with them.&#8221;</em></span>

                    and grandchildren &#8211; and would presumably like to see them

                    wife and daughter he reportedly relies on who are evidently
                    more sensible and gracious than he is. I assume he&#8217;d like to
                    make some truly &#8220;smart moves&#8221; and leave a good legacy, to
                    the best of his ability and that of his advisors. <br>
                    <br>
                    One of them, Chris Christie, though hated by good Democrats,
                    won my admiration long ago in a fiery speech&nbsp; defending
                    his Muslim New Jersey State Supreme Court nominee from the
                    prevailing &#8220;ignorance&#8221; (as he called it), and if appointed
                    to head the Justice Department, I have faith in his fairness
                    as well as his intelligence. <br>
                    <br>
                    Fourth, being in the driver&#8217;s seat has got to be a sobering
                    experience. The b.s. and electioneering are over, and his
                    extra-long meeting with President Obama tells me he&#8217;s
                    probably serious and humbled (if a guy like that could ever
                    be humbled) by the task before him. <br>
                    <br>
                    I&#8217;m hoping that one term as president will be more than
                    enough for him, more than enough on his résumé, and that
                    he&#8217;ll be anxious to move on soon. In fact some are
                    predicting he&#8217;ll probably take long, George-Bush-like
                    vacations and leave his VP mostly in charge. (Whether that&#8217;s
                    good or bad is another discussion). So I&#8217;m hoping he won&#8217;t
                    need to keep up the inflammatory and pandering rhetoric for
                    the sake of re-election, because I&#8217;m hoping he won&#8217;t want
                    it. <br>
                    <br>
                    I will never forgive or understand those who voted for him,
                    for letting him get away with the secret tax returns, the
                    denials of half the things he said and did, and, mostly, for
                    not repudiating his white supremacist supporters. And I
                    can&#8217;t imagine I would like the guy if I ever met him, but I
                    don&#8217;t expect to ever meet him. I&#8217;m hoping he&#8217;s not as
                    vindictive as he has sounded and has encouraged his
                    followers to be, partly because I have made my own
                    anti-Trump views have been very public, and am known to his
                    attorneys.&nbsp; <br>
                    <br>
                    His sons scare me to death, reminiscent of Saddam sons Uday
                    and Qusay for some reason, but that&#8217;s just an impression &#8211;
                    maybe in fact they&#8217;re great and fair humanitarians.<br>
                    <br>
                    Time will tell; I will try to be hopeful that President
                    Trump will not upend our world, and will rely on some people
                    experienced in government, and in give-and-take, to do more
                    good than harm.<br>

                    <br> <br>
                    We can&#8217;t all seem to agree about much lately, but perhaps we
                    can all agree that in order to address a problem we have to
                    have some accurate information, even if just one person&#8217;s
                    experience.<br>
                  </span><span class="style163"><br>
                    &nbsp;So, assuming we agree we do have a problem with
                    medical costs and coverage (including the specter of going
                    bankrupt from medical costs if not insurance costs), I&#8217;d
                    like to share a recent experience with surgery and
                    hospitalization:<br>
                    <br>
                    A few months ago, in the course of a general check-up, my
                    physician told me that my &#8220;outie&#8221; belly button is the start
                    of a hernia which, if it ever really popped out, would be a
                    serious medical problem. His advice was that if I could
                    afford it, I should get it reinforced by mesh.<br>
                    <br>
                    I could finally afford it with my new medical insurance,
                    Blue Cross, purchased through the &#8220;Marketplace&#8221; (ACA &#8211;
                    &#8220;Obamacare&#8221;) a few months later, so I proceeded. The surgeon
                    who was recommended to me said exactly what my doctor told
                    me &#8211; that it was not an urgent procedure but a choice to
                    prevent something serious that might or might not happen in
                    the future.<br>
                    <br>
                    So, having determined that all costs related to the
                    procedure would be covered, I got the surgery in late
                    December of 2015, in Albuquerque.&nbsp; I was discharged
                    almost immediately, a little too soon, according to some,
                    and sure enough I was taken to the emergency room here in
                    Las Vegas a couple days later, with a couple of painful
                    complications.<br>
                    <br>
                    I was diagnosed, X-rayed, treated a bit, opiated, and taken
                    by midnight ambulance back to Albuquerque, to the hospital
                    which had hosted the surgery. I was there for a couple scary
                    days before limping out and back to Las Vegas for several
                    weeks&#8217; very slow and uncomfortable recovery &#8211; which by the
                    way is what the surgeon had promised me in the first place.<br>
                    <br>
                    My point, though, is the costs, summarized here and rounded
                    off, and excluding those under $1,000, and figuring out
                    what&#8217;s what as best I can from all the billing names that
                    give no indication of what they are:<br>
                    <br>
                    &#8226; Surgeon:&nbsp; $3,800<br>
                    &#8226; Robotics technicians: $1,300<br>
                    &#8226; Anesthesia: $1,600<br>
                    &#8226; Hospital operating room and pre-op visit:&nbsp; $6,600<br>
                    (Total so far:&nbsp; $13,300)<br>
                    <br>
                    Now, getting into the realm of the surreal, in my opinion:<br>
                    &#8226; Emergency room in Las Vegas, approximately five hours:
                    $21,300<br>
                    &#8226; Emergency room physician (no surgery or anything
                    dramatic): $1,700<br>
                    &#8226; Ambulance ride to Albuquerque: $1,700<br>
                    <br>
                    &#8226; Now, getting even more surreal, two days in Lovelace
                    Hospital in Albuquerque; nothing dramatic, no surgery or
                    &#8220;procedures&#8221;: $87,500. (That&#8217;s right, $44,000 per day!)<br>
                    <br>
                    Total for this adventure: $125,500, figured conservatively.<br>
                    <br>
                    Was it &#8220;worth it&#8221;? Well, it&#8217;s nice to have had the repair,
                    but only if I were the successful mega-movie-producer I hope
                    to be could I have afforded it myself, at those prices. Was
                    it worth that much to &#8220;society&#8221; &#8211; us &#8211; &#8220;The Government,&#8221; who
                    paid for it? I doubt it.<br>
                    <br>
                    Why were the prices so ridiculously high? My understanding
                    is that it&#8217;s primarily to cover the costs of those who don&#8217;t
                    pay, due to being uninsured. No wonder Blue Cross had to
                    leave the &#8220;Marketplace!&#8221;<br>
                    <br>
                    How does every other industrialized society manage to have
                    good-to-excellent medical care covered by a &#8220;single-payer&#8221;
                    system for everyone (ask people from those countries how
                    good the medical care is or isn&#8217;t; don&#8217;t ask Rush Limbaugh
                    et al)? An incredible mystery! It could have something to do
                    with their lack of for-profit &#8220;healthcare&#8221; outfits, headed
                    by CEOs making tens or hundreds of millions of dollars a
                    year.<br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>A comparison:</strong><br>
                    Let&#8217;s compare the above to the experience of a local
                    physician who shattered his elbow in a bicycle accident in
                    Spain this past year. He was transported by ambulance to
                    urgent care, then to hospital, given X-rays, a complicated
                    four-hour surgery by a team of 10&nbsp; people he (a
                    physician) judged to be excellent, pinned and wired back
                    together, and kept in hospital for three days of IV
                    antibiotics due to the nature of the open contaminated
                    fracture into the joint.<br>
                    <br>
                    He was billed a total of $5,000, perhaps because he was not
                    an EU citizen paying into the system. The cost here in the
                    U.S. would have been at least what my total bill was, over
                    $100,000!<br>
                    <br>
                    Call that &#8220;Socialist,&#8221; call it &#8220;Herman,&#8221; as my doctor dad
                    used to say, but this remains the only country with a
                    million people or more declaring bankruptcy every year due
                    to medical bills, and millions staying in jobs they&#8217;d rather
                    not in order to have health insurance.<br>
                    <br>
                    The solution won&#8217;t come with Bernie Sanders or anyone else
                    being elected, in my opinion, but by our facing the problem
                    and the possibilities. And perhaps the solution for the
                    problems with our local, formerly &#8220;community owned&#8221; hospital
                    lies in the same direction.<br>

                  filmmaker Jim Terr has been a tenacious, if sometimes strange,
                  force in the locally-grown entertainment media market. Now Jim
                  reports that one of his short films - the one he says is his
                  best - will be produced as a two-hour radio drama for local
                  and national broadcast on KUNM, Albuquerque's NPR affiliate,
                  in the summer of 2007. Casting sessions were held last week,
                  bringing in over 100 actors to auditions in Santa Fe and
                  Albuquerque.<i> "The Home of Katie Archer" </i>has a familiar
                  ring; it started life as a story about an actor struggling to
                  make it as a full-time carpenter and part-time actor in a
                  small New Mexico town visited often by Hollywood movies and
                  settled by Hollywood actors. </font></p>

                  has since morphed into a larger tale with a historical back
                  story. Terr writes on his <a href="http://www.katiearcher.org">website</a>
                  that he's already spoken to several "well-known celebrities"
                  about cameo voices in his radio play. He's also hoping to

                    hopes that exposure of the new video will increase CD sales

                    credits and thanks YouTube for making it so easy for

                  Where to Find the Best Independent Films</strong><br>
                <br>
                If you are a fan of independent films, there are more options
                than ever that allow you to tap into the stream of releases
                entering the market. Technology has made it easier for producers
                and distributors to get their content into the homes and devices
                of audiences due to the emergence of mobile devices coupled with
                digital streaming. If you are a fan of indie films it does not
                take anywhere near as much effort to search for new sleeper hits
                as it did in the old days. Additionally, if you are looking for
                in depth documentaries that will open your eyes to the world
                around you the choices are more varied and plentiful with
                streaming services.<br>
                <br>
                In the olden days of VHS tapes and Mom n' Pop video stores in
                every small town as far as the eye can see, people that wanted
                to watch independent movies or underground documentaries had to
                search through the collections of passing caravans or worse:
                make bootlegs. It was a rough time but things have changed big
                time since then and now film connoisseurs can indulge their
                fancy by tapping into a number of great new sources that have
                sprouted up recently thanks to advances in streaming video.<br>
                <br>
                DirecTV offers an entire catalog of documentaries to select
                from, the range is as varied as the field. According to their
                directory there are over 350 to pick from the next time you sit
                down to watch. That is literally weeks of footage to immerse
                yourself and the family into. Your mind will be buzzing with all
                the great information to take in from the DirecTV documentary
                offerings. There is no way you know all this stuff or have
                watched all these, and if you try there will be more added
                before you can get through them all. Sign up for DirecTV using <a

                  href="http://www.SaveonTVDirect.com">www.SaveonTVDirect.com</a>
                to save a few dollars. <br>
                If you prefer streaming services like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix">Netflix</a>
                they have you covered. Thanks to the proliferation of mobile
                devices now it is possible to dive into a great film anywhere,
                so long as you have a subscription. They make available an ever
                expanding group of indie films from around the world, an
                impressive stock of cinema. Since they are now producing shows
                for distribution they have sort of entered the indie television
                field as well. There are plenty of amateur film makers putting
                their creations onto Vimeo as well.<br>
                <br>
                So the next time you are looking for a movie that is outside the
                Hollywood mainstream or seeking education through videography
                give these streaming options a try. You never know what you
                might discover, maybe while checking out the group of offerings
                you find a new personal classic. Just because they are high
                budget extravaganzas does not mean they are highly entertaining.
                Often times these movies have great actors that are working on a
                passion project for little more than the desire to see a movie
                get made, to tell a particular story or play a certain
                character. The documentaries take a risk to expose an issue or
                cause, in some cases risking the crew by adventuring into
                hostile territories or incurring financial responsibilities
                beyond the involved individuals personal capacity to account for
                the costs.<br>

                  <strong>GOTTA PEE</strong> </u><br>
                <br>
                Two women friends had gone for a girls' night out. Both were
                very faithful and loving wives, however they had gotten
                over-enthusiastic on the Bacardi Breezers. <br>
                <br>
                Incredibly drunk and walking home they needed to pee, so they
                stopped in the cemetery. <br>
                <br>
                One of them had nothing to wipe with so she thought she would
                take off her panties and use them. <br>
                <br>
                Her friend however was wearing a rather expensive pair of
                panties and did not want to ruin them. <br>
                <br>
                She was lucky enough to squat down next to a grave that had a
                wreath with a ribbon on it, so she proceeded to wipe with that.
                <br>
                <br>
                After the girls did their business, they proceeded to go home. <br>
                <br>
                The next day, the husband of one of the women was concerned that
                his normally sweet and innocent wife was still in bed hung over,
                so he phoned the other husband and said: <br>
                "These girl nights have got to stop! I'm starting to suspect the
                worst. My wife came home with no panties!!" <br>
                <br>
                "That's nothing," said the other husband, <br>
                "Mine came back with a card stuck to her ass that said..... <strong><em><br>

                  LAS VEGAS, N.M. &#8211; Conservative demagogues who are familiar
                  with Jim Terr might ask, &#8220;Jim, why do you hate America so
                  much?&#8221;</p>
                <p style="text-align: center;">Everyone else who has heard
                  Terr&#8217;s twisted country tunes about our current national morass
                  might wonder why he isn&#8217;t famous yet.</p>
                <p style="text-align: center;">Terr has been kicking around the
                  music and film business ever since he graduated from
                  Northwestern University in the early 1970s with a major in
                  partying and a minor in English literature.</p>
                <p style="text-align: center;">While Terr has written some
                  beautiful mainstream country tunes, he&#8217;s best-known for his
                  novelty songs, which take on corporate greed, the NRA,
                  menopause, Walmart, Glenn Beck, day trading, Santa Fe
                  tourists, the American health care system, Joe the Plumber,
                  Texas school board members, global warming, Karl Rove and
                  Facebook.</p>
                <p style="text-align: center;">Have we left anything out?</p>
                <p style="text-align: center;">Oh, yes. Terr has also skewered
                  common grammatical errors, the BP oil spill and NPR
                  correspondent Susan Stamberg&#8217;s annual Thanksgiving piece on
                  her mother-in-law&#8217;s cranberry relish recipe.</p>
                <p style="text-align: center;">&#8220;Believe me,&#8221; Terr assured me,
                  &#8220;I&#8217;m an equal opportunity annoyer.&#8221;</p>
                <p style="text-align: center;">Terr, who has lived and worked in
                  Santa Fe for most of his career, is back in his hometown of
                  Las Vegas these days. Terr (rhymes with &#8220;burr&#8221; &#8211; as in burr
                  under the saddle of just about everybody) has been on my radar
                  screen for a couple of decades, mostly because of his profuse
                  letter-to-the-editor offerings, but it was two of his most
                  recent songs that persuaded me I needed to finally meet him.</p>
                <p style="text-align: center;">&#8220;The Campaign Finance Song&#8221; is a
                  subversive little piece that takes on the fundraising system
                  that keeps members of Congress chasing campaign contributions.
                  Terr&#8217;s solution is for each of us to just kick in six bucks
                  and eliminate the possibility of special interest influence.</p>
                <p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
                <p style="text-align: center;">And &#8220;Standard &amp; Poor&#8221;
                  examines the economic slide of the upper middle class. &#8220;I
                  guess I&#8217;ve been downgraded, now I&#8217;m standard and poor,&#8221; is the
                  money line.</p>
                <p style="text-align: center;">Over coffee and papitas at the
                  Spic &amp; Span cafe, a short walk from his family home, Terr
                  told me that finding targets for satire is as easy for him as
                  tuning in to the news of the day or listening to people talk.
                  His songbook grows thicker every day.</p>
                <p style="text-align: center;">&#8220;Since I&#8217;ve been in Vegas, I&#8217;ve
                  been on a real amped-up song-writing streak,&#8221; Terr said.
                  &#8220;Sometimes, I write a couple a day.&#8221;</p>
                <p style="text-align: center;">It&#8217;s not like there isn&#8217;t plenty
                  of material out there for a willing satirist, and Terr sees
                  something to get worked up about everywhere he looks.</p>
                <p style="text-align: center;">Indeed, Terr has a stunning array
                  of songs and videos available on his websites,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.jimterr.com/">www.jimterr.com</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a

                  and on YouTube, where he recently passed 600,000 views [now
                  over one million, as of June 2014]. His oeuvre includes a
                  spoof commercial spot for turquoise-encrusted jackalope
                  droppings as well as &#8220;Chicken Stock,&#8221; a Jewish parody of
                  Woodstock, and a rock &#8216;n&#8217; roll song about a public health care
                  option accompanied by singing hamsters.</p>
                <p style="text-align: center;">Which is to say he&#8217;s not exactly
                  mainstream.</p>
                <p style="text-align: center;">Still, Terr put out a record
                  called, &#8220;Please Cut My Song, Mr. Travis&#8221; and even though Mr.
                  Travis has not yet complied, Terr hopes to someday write a
                  country hit.</p>
                <p style="text-align: center;">Even though he has been aired on
                  NPR and other nationwide radio broadcasts and he has released
                  a handful of CDs, he says he barely makes a living writing and
                  recording songs. His new CD, unreleased and as yet unnamed, is
                  mostly comedy, only some of it political, and Terr said he&#8217;s
                  tried to trim out the most partisan tracks.</p>
                <p style="text-align: center;">&#8220;It just cuts back your market to
                  have songs about hating Republicans,&#8221; Terr acknowledged.</p>
                <p style="text-align: center;">Even so, the new CD will include
                  &#8220;What We Need Is Another Texas President&#8221; and &#8220;Bosses of the
                  World Unite.&#8221;</p>
                <p style="text-align: center;">And, for the record, Terr doesn&#8217;t
                  really hate America. He just wants to keep it from flushing
                  down the drain.</p>
                <p style="text-align: center;">&#8220;I don&#8217;t hate Republicans,&#8221; Terr
                  assured me. &#8220;I&#8217;m anti-demagoguery and mass hysteria and so I
                  attack it when I see it.&#8221;</p>
                <p style="text-align: center;">Terr also likes to take a break
                  from politics and just have some fun. Two of his most popular
                  recent releases are &#8220;Mama Don&#8217;t Send Me to the Big Box Store&#8221;
                  and &#8220;Do They Have Email in Heaven?&#8221; The punch line to that
                  tune, which could be the official anthem of the 2000s, is
                  &#8220;cause if not, I don&#8217;t want to go.&#8221;</p>
