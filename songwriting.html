        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Santa 
          Fe singer/songwriter Jim Terr will host a songwriting workshop Saturday, 
          October 28 for practicing songwriters as well as those interested in 
          entering this field. The daytime workshop will be followed by a showcase 
          performance by participants for guests and the public that evening. 
          </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
          workshop will consist of a brief discussion of songwriting technique 
          and business, and constructive critiques of participants' songs-in-progress, 
          and will be held from 10 AM until 4 PM at the Mustang Room of the Cowboy 
          Hall of Fame Restaurant in Santa Fe. The showcase will be at 8 PM in 
          the North Room of Cloud Cliff Bakery, 1805 Second Street in Santa Fe, 
          with a $5 cover charge.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Terr's 
          songs have been broadcast on most major radio networks and programs, 
          and in over 20 foreign countries, according to BMI. In reviews in the 
          US and England, his songwriting has been compared to that of Tom T. 
          Hall, Bobby Bare, Ray Stevens Shel Silverstein and others. As a song 
          publisher, he has published songs which have been recorded by Hank Williams 
          Jr., Crystal Gayle and others. His jingles, including "Toss No Mas," 
          "Sing a Song of Snapple," and the Ken Ashner Auto Sales jingles, have 
          been heard locally and nationally. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Terr 
          says that although his forte is country music and satire songs, the 
          same songwriting principles apply to all songwriting, and all styles 
          are welcome in the workshop. "The emphasis will be on commercial songwriting; 
          that is, writing songs which can be cut by other artists. In the country 
          and pop fields, most hit songs are written not by the recording artists 
          themselves but by songwriters, and a hit song can earn the songwriter 
          hundreds of thousands of dollars in royalties." </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Besides 
          that, Terr said, "Songwriting is the most fun you can have legally, 
          and a great vehicle for self-expression. And the performance showcase 
          on Saturday night will be a great way for workshop participants to share 
          this fun with our guests." Admission to the showcase will be $5 for 
          those not participating in the workshop. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Pre-registration 
          is required, by calling 989-9298. Cost of the workshop is on a sliding 
          scale of $25 - $40, with three high school student scholarships offered.

        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SKILL 
          LEVEL: While this workshop will be suitable for beginning songwriters, 
          it should also be valuable for practicing songwriters, because we will 
          be extensively critiquing a song by each participant, and each critique 
          and feedback tends to be valuable for all participants. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">HIGH 
          SCHOOL SCHOLARSHIPS: We are offering full scholarships for three Santa 
          Fe high school students. To apply, send a brief letter describing (1) 
          your interest and involvement in songwriting, (2) your need for a scholarship, 
          (3) what high school you attend, (4) your address and phone number, 
          and (5) include the lyric sheet (with copyright notice ©) to a song 
          you have written. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Do 
          this as soon as possible, since we will try to notify you by phone at 
          least one week prior to the workshop, whether or not you have been awarded 
          the scholarship. Scholarships are awarded at our sole discretion, and 
          our decision is final. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WHAT 
          TO BRING: Bring a cassette or CD of a song you have written, along with 
          26 copies of the lyric sheet for other participants. If you do not bring 
          a cassette or CD, bring a guitar or small keyboard to accompany yourself 
          in performing the song for the group. Of course you should also bring 
          something to take notes on, and for the showcase Saturday evening bring 
          a guitar or keyboard (or a cassette or CD with background music for 
          your song). </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">LUNCH 
          BREAK: The workshop will run from appWe will take a 1- or 1-1/2 hour 
          lunch break from the workshop around 1 PM on Saturday. Please consider 
          having lunch (or dinner) at the Cowgirl Hall of Fame Restaurant, in 
          return for their generosity in letting us use the Mustang Room for our 
          meeting, and also in consideration of their excellent food!</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PRE-REGISTRATION: 
          Pre-registration is required, and the workshop will be limited to about 
          25 participants so that we can devote adequate time to critiquing each 
          person's song. Therefore you should register as soon as possible if 
          you wish to participate. Send your check, along with your name, address 
          and phone numbers (daytime and evening) to: Blue Canyon Productions, 
          POB 6622, Santa Fe, NM 87502. Optional: please indicate your skill level 
          and preferred type of music.</font></p>

        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Here 
          are some words about songwriting from Tom T. Hall, a legendary and extremely 
          successful singer/songwriter who happens to be my hero. I think it's 
          profound and worth thinking about: </font></p>
      </div>
      <blockquote> 
        <div align="left"> 
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"My goal is to 
            establish a true voice - not colored by prejudice, politics or preference. 
            If you're telling a story, you have to separate all that. You have 
            to be careful not to make judgements, and be honest. That's the main 
            thing. Just tell the tale." </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"You have to have 
            a series of magnificent little accidents to write songs. Most of them 
            are only two and a half to three minutes long. You have to get a lot 
            done in that time." </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The trick to 
            being a songwriter is learning how to be a person first. A songwriter 
            isn't really all that hard to be if you don't want to do anything 
            more than rhyme moon and June and forget it. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To be a real person 
            is much harder. If you can somehow manage that, to become somebody 
            you have some faith in and can believe in and trust now and then, 
            well, you're ready to become a songwriter as I see songwriters. If 
            you write about yourself as a person then you're writing about everybody. 
            See, we're all basically the same with just a few minor differences. 
            But it's those little differences that enable one man to become president 
            and another a bum. Those differences are what I write about." </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"I found my success 
            as a songwriter when I started writing about things I had done and 
            places I had been. My early efforts were what we in the business sometimes 
            call 'Little Darlin' songs. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">[But] the first 
            of [my] personal story songs was 'A Week In a Country Jail.' I wrote 
            it for someone else who was doing an album of prison songs. The closest 
            thing I knew about was a country jail, and so, the song. I recorded 
            the song myself and after the success it enjoyed I decided that people 
            could be interested in little personal stories of mine. I t turned 
            out to be the backbone of my whole career and earned me the sobriquet 
            The Storyteller. As for my favorite song that anyone has recorded 
            it would have to be my first one. Jimmy C. Newman recorded 'D.J. For 
            A Day' on Decca records in 62 (I think) and launched me on a career 
            that led to a home in the country and a head full of white hair."

          Letters of Recommendation:</i></b> </p>
        <p>To Whom It May Concern:<br>
          <br>
          I attended a songwriter's workshop by Jim Terr. It was definitely worthwhile. 
          Jim's passion for songwriting shows through in his presentation and 
          critique. The information he presented gave much food for thought in 
          perfecting my own style and generated a desire to write more (and better) 
          songs. I appreciated his constructive criticism and would recommend 
          him to anyone interested in songwriting.<br>
          <br>
          Gary Peters<br>
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>To Whom It May Concern:<br>
          <br>
          Recently, I participated in Jim Terr's songwriting workshop in Santa 
          Fe. Though I am a novice songwriter and a little on the shy side--and 
          was worried about my abilities compared to the other students--Jim made 
          me feel extremely comfortable, and encouraged me to &quot;throw caution 
          to the wind,&quot; and share one of my songs-in-progress with the group. 
          I did, and was relieved to find that nobody laughed or stared at me 
          agape with embarrassment for me. The &quot;critique&quot; portion of 
          the workshop, which I'd feared the most, was gentle (though infinitely 
          helpful), and I walked out of the workshop with a solid foundation for 
          a potentially successful song.<br>
          <br>
          Jim writes mainly country music, but his ideas and experience with songwriting 
          are not at all limited to that genre. I walked in with what I might 
          classify as an &quot;indie-rock&quot; tune, and found that Jim's basic 
          &quot;rules&quot; for songwriting are pretty universal. The same tips 
          and suggestions he had for the country-oriented participants worked 
          for my song, too.<br>
          <br>
          As far as Jim's appeal as a teacher, let's just say there's nothing 
          to worry about there. He's a welcoming, funny, intuitive guy, but also 
          doesn't waste time in getting down to business. I felt that participating 
          in Jim's workshop was one of the most worthwhile endeavors I'd made 
          in a long time. I hope that he organizes another one soon.<br>
          <br>
          Sincerely,<br>
          Sarah Meadows<br>
          Santa Fe<br>
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>To Whom It May Concern:<br>
          <br>
          Attending Jim Terr's songwriting workshop was an interesting and rewarding 
          experience. His critique was sincere and knowledgeable but not degrading. 
          He gave good useable information. I enjoyed hearing his creations and 
          also that of others present. If you are interested in songwriting, you 
          should attend Jim's workshop.<br>
