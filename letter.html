<FONT FACE="Calisto MT"><P 
><P>Dear Reader, </P>
<P>&#9; I take strong exception to your cavalier attitude....oh, I’m sorry, I was momentarily possessed by that letter-writing demon that so often overtakes me.</P>
        <P>&#9;I’ve always appreciated meeting people who tell me that they’ve 
          been following my letters, song satires and essays for years, and have 
          enjoyed them and felt they expressed things that they’ve been thinking 
          as well. But the immediate impetus for putting together this compilation 
          was hearing recently that some people had liked my essay, <I>&quot;30 
          Things That Bother Me More than Gay Marriage&quot;</I> (page 76), well 
          enough to have made scores of copies to send to friends around the country. 
          I figured &quot;What the hell, why not put together a collection?&quot;</P>
<P>&#9;Obviously, I love this art form. I find the Letters section of  newspapers, magazines and National Public Radio news broadcasts to be the most interesting and exciting part. I am always amazed at the clarity, passion, insight and articulateness of so many of the letters I see published and hear broadcast.</P>
<P>&#9;After seeing the quantity of material in this book, you may be surprised to know that I don’t even subscribe to a daily newspaper; I get most of my daily news from NPR. My urge to respond--my sense of outrage, frustration and curiosity--is such that if I were to read the paper daily, I would probably want to write so many letters that I’d have no time for anything else. As it is, I usually have to read no more than five pages of a newspaper or magazine, or hear five minutes of a radio program, before I come across something I feel compelled to respond to.<I> Is there a charity, a medical research institute, to help people like me?</i></P>
<P>&#9;I am under no illusion that letter-writing takes anywhere near the skill or commitment of actually being politically involved, going to city council meetings, or raising a family for that matter, but hopefully it makes some impact.</P>
<P>&#9;To me, the world seems filled with danger: people who think the government wants to take their guns away, but who evidently are willing to trust government workers* and their computers to trigger or avert nuclear war; corporations relentlessly assuming human rights and civil rights that were meant only for citizens and definitely <I>not</I> for corporations; a testosterone-laden Congress that can tackle just about anything except two of their most basic duties: coming up with a budget and confirming judges and ambassadors; and media manipulation and monopoly, which is no concern for people who only wish to have their existing point of view reinforced, but <I>extremely</I> worrisome to those of us who like to absorb and weigh opposing and far-ranging points of view.</P>
<P>&#9;Demagoguery has been my focus, my obsession, for better or worse, since I was a teenager, exposed to (perhaps too much) reading on the Nazis and the Holocaust. I am extremely touchy and fearful about people in positions of authority who misdirect other people’s thinking in a hateful, divisive way. And I’m absolutely <I>phobic </I>about the whole propaganda industry, from paid &quot;Spin Doctors&quot; who make black white and white black, to pamphleteers, publishers and talk radio hosts who supply single-source information consumers with a skewed &quot;party line&quot; of any sort, thereby discouraging a broad, balanced view.</P>
<P>&#9;I am outraged by people who exploit and make millions of people miserable; by politics dominated by attack ads, <I>fear</I> of attack ads and manipulative &quot;Morning in America&quot; ads; and by phony &quot;front&quot; organizations and spokes-people with hidden affiliations and agendas.</P>
<P>&#9;All of these are well in evidence on talk radio. If you’ve never listened, and heard the frightening array of ignoramuses and conspiracy theorists who seem to be out there in large numbers--as well as the wonderfully <I>thoughtful </I>people of all persuasions--I’d recommend it.</P>
<P>&#9;Talk host Rush Limbaugh, an otherwise bright, funny and good-hearted guy, is such a one-trick pony, construing every ill in the world as part of a &quot;liberal mindset&quot; of his own defining, attributing to a &quot;liberal malaise&quot; every social and ecological concern and every effort to reduce suffering in the world, that he’s finally become too boring for me to listen to. </P>
<P>&#9;I thank you for picking up this book, and considering its contents. I’ve got clippings buried somewhere in my stacks about scientific studies showing that people who express their opinions, in writing or otherwise--and eccentrics in general--live longer. On both counts I expect to be around until at least age 100 (barring nuclear or chemical/biological war or major ecological disasters), still typing away, still exploring how good individuals can become so evil, even murderous--<I>intentionally or unintentionally--</I>when they become part of large organizations, including countries.</P>
<P>        I hope that this collection might inspire you to try your hand at writing letters-to-the-editor and essays, if you haven’t already.</P>

          <H3>TOP RADIO TALK SHOW HOSTS WEIGH ON THE QUESTION: WHY DID THE CHICKEN 
            CROSS THE ROAD?</H3>
          <P>Satire by Jim Terr</P>
          <P><em>[As printed in TALKERS Magazine, April 1998 issu<i>e]</i><br>
            </em></P>
        </CENTER>
        <P>In an effort to get to the very core of their philosophical belief 
          systems, we put one of the great questions of the ages to some of today’s 
          top talk radio personalities (or reasonable facsimiles thereof). 
        <P><B>RUSH LIMBAUGH:</B> Those who would even <I>ask</I> such a question 
          are really out to confuse you, to make you so disempowered and disillusioned 
          that you have no alternative but to turn either to Washington or to 
          an authority like myself for an answer--and I don’t need to tell you 
          which one is going to give you The Truth. 
        <P>Having said that, this chicken thing is the inevitable result of three 
          decades of the Great Society and the whole tree-hugging, feel-good counter-culture 
          that has almost completely overwhelmed this country. Why should the 
          chicken stay on his side of the road when he can find more free chicken 
          feed and greater entitlements on the other side of the road? 
        <P>With such a shining example of do-your-own-thing thinking as we have 
          in the White House right now, is it any wonder that the chicken isn’t 
          content to just stay on his own side of the road, put his shoulder to 
          the grindstone and do whatever it takes to create a prosperous future 
          for himself? Of course the liberal media would label this view as extreme 
          right-wing, when in fact it’s just common sense. 
        <P><B>G. GORDON LIDDY:</B> I don’t pretend to understand the mind of a 
          chicken. The chicken is about the farthest creature from the hard-headed, 
          testosterone-charged realist that I aspire to be, and--in fact--am. 
          However, I will say that if that chicken ever crosses the road into 
          <I>my</I> yard, he’s going to find out in about two seconds what American 
          technology and firepower and martial arts training are all about, and 
          he’ll quickly find his beak firmly embedded in his cloaca. And if he 
          thinks I’m kidding, let him try it. 
        <P><B>HOWARD STERN:</B> Clearly there’s a radio on his side of the road 
          blaring out Don Imus, and the Stern show is playing on the other side, 
          so he wants to move over to the other side as quickly as possible--and 
          who can blame him? And in addition to that it’s probably a female chicken, 
          and obviously not only my entertainment value and mastery of all media 
          but my sex appeal as well, transcend even inter-species boundaries. 
          If, on the other hand, it’s a male, then my weenie is probably even 
          smaller than his, but the size of my audience more than makes up for 
          it. 
        <P><B>DOCTOR LAURA:</B> This is a perfect example of someone being led 
          around by his so-called “feelings”, a highly overrated and notoriously 
          unreliable way to make decisions. This chicken should ask himself: Do 
          I see other chickens whom I admire, and whom society admires, crossing 
          the road? Does the Bible--or the Koran--say it’s right to cross the 
          road whenever you feel like it? Just because all the movies and television 
          shows say it’s all right to cross the road if you feel like it, that 
          doesn’t make it so. 
        <P><B>DR. DEAN EDELL:</B> As a matter of fact, I got an interesting fax 
          today that throws light on this. This is from...let’s see...a Dr. Pylos 
          Hardrock at Johns Hopkins--and of course Johns Hopkins couldn’t make 
          a mistake, right? Let’s see, out of 485 chickens in this double-blind 
          study that even <I>thought</I> of crossing the road, only five, a little 
          over one percent, actually did it. And when these chickens were dissected, 
          what do you suppose they found? That’s right, an enlarged left frontal 
          lobe not present in the other 480 chickens, which of course demonstrates 
          that crossing the road is a genetic predisposition. 
        <P>But more importantly--and no one stops to ask this question--what are 
          they going to do with all those dead chickens? 
        <P><B>THE DOLANS:</B> This chicken is a good friend of ours who’s going 
          to be on our show next week, so if you think we’re going to speculate 
          on his motives you’re crazy. But a quick check of our vast database 
          reveals...yes, try this number, it’s the Kansas State Agriculture Department, 
          Ambulatory Poultry Hotline, 1-800-CHICKEN. The smart investor will take 
          the initiative to check a few independent sources like this before investing 
          in either chickens or transportation stocks. 
        <P><B>ART BELL:</B> We had someone on just last week, that professor who 
          was run out of Berkeley for being too free-thinking, for not toeing 
          the party line, yes, Dr. Heimlich Drebner, who has some incredible information 
          on this. 
        <P>Evidently those chickens who cross the road are by and large those 
          who have been abducted and implanted with homing devices which cause 
          them to walk north in odd-numbered months and south in even-numbered 
          months. If there’s a road in the way, well that’s just a matter of circumstance. 
          You see, it’s not the road, it’s the direction. The road thing is just 
          a distraction designed to keep us from seeing the real pattern here.</P>
        <P><B>JIM BOHANNON:</B> There’s been a lot of confusion and demagoguery 
          on this issue, and tomorrow night I’m going to have two guests representing 
          the two extreme ends of this controversy, and we’re going to hash it 
          out for once and for all. Don’t miss it.</P>
        <P><B>JIM HIGHTOWER:</B> That chicken doesn’t really intend to cross the 
          road, so it’s a waste of time trying to figure out why. </P>
        <P>What’s really going on is that the agribusinesses that produce his 
          feed are bulking it up with toxic solvents and petroleum by-products 
          that not only add nothing nutritionally to his diet, but which are eating 
          away at his brain and destroying his sense of direction. That chicken 
          is at the bottom of the economic ladder, and he’s paying for it every 
          day. And <I>you’re</I> paying to subsidize the agribusiness that’s poisoning 
          the chicken--and you too if you eat that chicken. </P>
        <P>If he doesn’t get hit by a car or eaten by you or me, he’s going to 
          live out his long, miserable life in a state of disorientation and anguish, 
          and if you think Big Business cares one whit about that, well, I’ve 
          got a very large, deep canyon in Arizona I’d like to sell you.</P>
        <P><B>DON IMUS:</B> Obviously that chicken has spied a foxy chick on the 
          other side, and he’s so stupid he thinks she’s going to go for him if 
          he can only make it over to <I>her</I> side, strutting like Sylvester 
          Stallone or Christian Slater or whoever’s hot this week. But what he 
          doesn’t realize is that when he gets over to her side, she’s suddenly 
          going to get very ugly and say, “Hey shmuck! Get lost! Who do you think 
          you are?” It’s sad but true. And then he’ll try the same thing the next 
          day. A real loser. 
        <P><B>BRUCE WILLIAMS:</B> I’ve owned many chicken-related businesses over 
          the years, and I’ll tell ya: All that clucks is not gold. </P>
        <P>It’s hard to accept that when you’re young, when you’ve got eggs and 
          gold dust in your eyes, but it’s true. There’ll always be chickens wandering 
          away from where you want them to be, meandering over toward the other 
          side of the road, and blam!--they get hit by a beautiful ‘56 Buick or 
          a cherry ‘61 Caddy convertible. I’ve owned both, and I can tell ya a 
          chicken is no match for either of them. No contest. And there will always 
          be enough of these wayward chickens to bring your profit margin down 
          to zero. I’ll tell ya: bet on the car, bet on the road, but don’t bet 
          on that chicken. 
        <P><B>MICHAEL REAGAN:</B> There’s a bill pending in the Senate, S.B. 201, 
          you can read all about it on my Website, and even more about it in my 
          newsletter, it’s entitled “The Freedom for Chickens Act”, but the name 
          is deceptive, as is always the case with these liberal-sponsored bills, 
          because the true intent of this bill is no less than the total destruction

          <P>Since we've conquered poverty<BR>
            And put an end to war,<BR>
            Since we've all discovered <BR>
            What this life on earth is for,<BR>
            Since we've made a paradise<BR>
            Of this precious, Godly place,<BR>
            Let's gather all that wisdom<BR>
            And move to outer space.</P>
