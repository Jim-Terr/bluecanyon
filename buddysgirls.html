      <h2>Feature film: <i>“BuDDy's Girls”</i>™ <i></i></h2>
      <p>Thank you for taking a look at this. </p>
      <p>Although this regards a probable feature film project, it <i>is NOT
          AN OFFER OF INVESTMENT </i>. This page contains a general overview
          of the project. If after reading you are interested in more details,
          you can e-mail me below. </p>
      <p>Although I have not produced a feature film, I have been involved in
        several, and I have some good contacts in the industry. I have produced
        several nationally-recognized and award-winning documentaries and shorts,
        and I am determined to produce this feature in New Mexico if at all possible. </p>
      <p><i>“BuDDy's Girls”™ </i>will be a “mockumentary,” in the vein <i>“Spinal
          Tap”, “Best in Show,” “Waiting for Guffman” </i>and <i> “A Mighty Wind,” </i> but
          closer to a real documentary. Using that approach, good-but-not-famous
          actors, and the “24p” digital video technology offering film look at
          much reduced cost, this full-length feature can be shot for as little
          as <b>two percent </b> of the average Hollywood feature film budget! </p>
      <p>The story will center around our character “BuDDy.” To get a general
        idea of BuDDy, and my comic sensibility, see BuDDy's Old Fashioned Web
        Site ( <a href="http://www.yourfriendbuddy.com/">www.YourFriendBuDDy.com </a>)
        and see video sample at bottom of this page. </p>
      <p>The story is centered around those numerous glamour-and-fitness babes
        who have websites selling their photos and videos, such as those below.
        The film will be <i>packed </i> with them, and needless to say this will
        provide much of the commercial appeal. </p>
      <p>But the story is much more – tricky, interesting, surprising, multi-layered – and
        respectful -- not at all a “skin flick.” In fact, it could end up with
        an “R” or even a “PG” rating, while still having all the sex appeal you
        might imagine. </p>
      <p>Why was the ad that brought you here headlined “Very Wealthy Bachelors...”?
        Simply because the film, being a “mockumentary,” will <i>document the
        entire process </i> of making the film, so there will be plenty of room
        for on-camera participation by the investors involved – with all the
        social opportunities that might go with it! </p>
      <p>Again, <i>THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR INVESTMENT. </i>Nor is the
        upcoming meeting, planned fo &nbsp;r late June , probably in Albuquerque,
        where more details will be available. </p>
      <p>The admission price of that meeting, in order to “self-select” those
        might be serious participants, will be $90.00, two-thirds of which will
        go to charity. If you are interested and might like to attend, see below: </p>
      <p><i>I have read the information above, I am seriously interested, and
          would like more information on the upcoming meeting, so please <a href="mailto:bluecanyon2@juno.com?subject=BuDDy%27s%20Girls">contact
    me</a> . </i></p>
