                <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I was born 
                  June 26, 1938 in Berlin, Germany. It was but a few months after 
                  my birth that the &quot;crystal night&quot; occurred. That doesn't 
                  mean where I'll become famous. Crystal Night was an edict to 
                  destroy all synagogues and Jewish owned shops as a prelude for 
                  serious anti-Jewish action in Germany. I don't know whether 
                  that also went on in Austria. I'm not certain about that. I 
                  know that it was all over Germany at the same time-November 
                  8, 9, 10-it was actually 3 days in Germany. And my grandfather, 
                  my father's father, was living with us at the time. He was pretty 
                  dismayed at what was happening and it fact killed himself on 
                  the second night of Crystal Night in my parent's apartment, 
                  because he felt he was keeping them from being able to take 
                  care of themselves for the future. He saw it as a grim end to 
                  Jews and Germany.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
                  For me, I was really born into that. Germany had stripped the 
                  Jews of everything they had-financial, in the form of savings, 
                  and in the form of privileges that most of us take for granted. 
                  Every day privileges, by the time I was born. My father was 
                  already without work by then and went into forced labor in late 
                  1939. That was the only way you had any work in order to secure 
                  stamps you needed to buy food in Germany. There was no other 
                  way. And your stamps were marked &quot;Jew&quot; of course. 
                  So, my mother avoided that due to a clerical that was made with 
                  respect to her maiden name versus her married name. So they 
                  never would have found her and then would have misfiled her 
                  card under the first letter &quot;Z&quot; instead of &quot;L&quot;. 
                  So they would have never found her, never.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So my parents, 
                  one was at home teaching languages to perspective immigrants. 
                  The door was not quite shut yet for some. And the other was 
                  busy doing forced labor for (Albert) Speer--a man who was a 
                  building designer, architect and whatnot, of rooms and old buildings 
                  under Hitler's regime. He was in charge of tearing down bombed 
                  buildings that had to be dismantled to make them safe for the 
                  public. Jews had to do that without being allowed to wear gloves 
                  that he would suffer the punishment of the cuts he would get 
                  from handling brick and cement, and all these sorts of things. 
                  You were not allowed to protect yourself. Eventually, though, 
                  things caught up with my mother and she did forced labor at 
                  Graf Zeppelin-you know, those blimps. And I was eventually sent 
                  to a Jewish kindergarten because our life had already been so 
                  narrowed down by them. The plan really was for Jews to be isolated, 
                  starvation. So it's isolation, starvation, and annihilation. 
                  That was the three-phase plan. We already isolated, living in 
                  a house for Jews only. And in 1943 we finally had to go into 
                  hiding in the attic of that building where an elderly couple 
                  who had owned the building and clandestinely still owned the 
                  building. She was a German lawyer who was cooperating with them. 
                  So they had some money at least. They were 70 and didn't have 
                  to work for that reason. Anyway, they shared their little attic 
                  place with the three of us, and that was in March 5, 1943 that 
                  we went into that attic after my other grandfather, Mom's father, 
                  was taken from the Jewish hospital in Berlin and my mother's 
                  8-year younger sister and her husband volunteered to go with 
                  him to Terezienstat when that hospital was liquidated of all 
                  Jewish personnel and patients.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the attic 
                  we were able to stay for about 3, 4, 5 weeks, I'm not sure, 
                  but the portier as it's called in German-I don't know what that 
                  is called in English-it's sort of a building maintenance person 
                  who is actually sent there to spy on people and was rewarded 
                  for spying as in, are there chicken feathers in the trash, and 
                  if so, why, because Jews are not allowed to have chicken as 
                  a meat. So he was watchful and well trained despite his IQ level 
                  of who knows how low. People became well-trained in spying. 
                  It's a natural thing to denounce people somehow for a reward. 
                  We stayed there until the Gestapo came for us, and they broke 
                  into that attic. They were really looking for the other couple, 
                  but they escaped. At this point, when this happened, I was not 
                  quite 5. My birthday was in June, this was March 4, 5, when 
                  we went though there. The Gestapo finally was led to the attic 
                  hiding place by the &quot;Patyea&quot; who had noticed new plaster 
                  where old should have been, and they broke in. And there we 
                  were, my father, father and I, and the other couple named Levant, 
                  and they wanted to know our last name. They weren't even looking 
                  for us, as it turned out, and they couldn't say our Jewish name, 
                  Goldstein. One of the Gestapo people hauled off and smacked 
                  my father in the face, and I was terrified because they had 
                  revolvers. They asked him repeatedly what his name was, and 
                  I couldn't understand why he wouldn't tell them. An understanding 
                  between my mother and my father at that point. The Gestapo of 
                  course were plainclothesmen, at that point dark suits, coats, 
                  green hats with the little feather. </font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So my father 
                  used the opportunity-he had a key on him at all times. And they 
                  had pre-arranged if they ever broke into the place that he, 
                  my mother, and I would be able to make a run for it. He locked 
                  the Gestapo, who had gone running after the other couple in 
                  the second little tiny room, who had created a diversion, a 
                  pretend escape. There was no escape from that room actually. 
                  We locked them all in together and made down the stairs as fast 
                  as we could to an escape place that we had in the wall on which 
                  rubble had been piled. We went down and my father grabbed me, 
                  held me, and walked across the post office courtyard. Downstairs 
                  of that apartment building was a post office-west 50 I think 
                  is its number-it still is its number. And we had to come out 
                  of the archway that the postal trucks would drive though and 
                  there were trucks with all the people loaded on them. And my 
                  father kept saying, &quot;Walk slowly, slowly&quot;&#133;He 
                  put me down and I walked between them. I remember not stepping 
                  on the lines like every child does. I didn't understand it. 
                  But, as it was no one called our name because it is often easy 
                  for people who would trap themselves to see someone make an 
                  attempt at escape. In this case family Grunstein, to denounce 
                  and say &quot;there they go.&quot;</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The trucks 
                  on the street in front of the building were loaded up with Jews 
                  that had already been rounded up in the general neighborhood. 
                  And, of course, Jews had to live in specified houses. They couldn't 
                  live just where they chose. Our house was called a &quot;Jew 
                  House&quot;, and was so designated. The trucks were going to 
                  deport people-first taken to a holding center within Berlin, 
                  and then from there, as we learned later, the majority went 
                  to Auschwitz direct, and in some cases to other camps and then 
                  into the system of annihilation or whatever. It was mostly old 
                  people or young people with children who hadn't the means to 
                  leave like ourselves, who were a part of that roundup. The healthy, 
                  wealthy and wise, and those who had money in other countries 
                  due to business relationships say ten years earlier, had left 
                  Germany. More than 50% of all German-Jews had left Germany.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">No one called 
                  out or name, which would have been a dead giveaway. Gaulstein 
                  is as Jewish as it gets. Surely people knew us on that block, 
                  since my kindergarten was on that block, which I attended six 
                  days a week, and we were fed beets there at every meal every 
                  day. That was the only food-boiled red beets. To this day, I 
                  don't eat beets. We jumped into a streetcar, without money, 
                  without a suitcase, without anything but what we had on. But 
                  my very creative father who had a Berlin mouth-a Berlin mouth 
                  is similar to a New York mouth-and with that mouth he said&#133; 
                  &quot;Oh, forgot my wallet at home. Can I give you this silver 
                  knife,&quot; that he had in his pocket for our fares, &quot;and 
                  then I'll retrieve it at the streetcar barnyard.&quot; Of course 
                  we know it would never go there because people were grabbing 
                  hold of anything because it's wartime and all efforts were geared 
                  toward making bombs and annihilation mechanisms for either Jews, 
                  Gypsies and other groups that were so designated by the regime 
                  as well as people in other countries, to destroy them, to dominate 
                  people in the entire world. </font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Which was 
                  nearly successful.<br>
                  And that began our underground life, more or less. We stayed 
                  one night, I remember we walked into a cigar store. This was 
                  a person who had been a customer of his-a non-Jew of course. 
                  Jews had no business. And he had still continued to buy for 
                  some time, illegally, cigars from my father's distributorship. 
                  And he said, &quot;You can stay one night, but that's all I 
                  can risk.&quot; Because the penalty was one as good as it was 
                  for Jews be sent to a camp for having harbored a Jew. So we 
                  stayed. I remember I had a terrible cough. Had that in the attic 
                  already to a point where my parents used to put me into a separate 
                  attic alone in case somebody heard me cough and found me, and 
                  didn't want to give away the four adult people if I was caught. 
                  Well, I coughed a lot at the cigar man's that night. From there 
                  on we somehow caught up with the people that my father had met 
                  in a green grocery that was allowed to sell to Jews. Like collards, 
                  and all these kinds of greenery. And that woman's niece was 
                  a student at the Humbolt University in Berlin, and she turned 
                  to my father who, of course, was wearing a star, and said, &quot;If 
                  you ever need a room you can contact me,&quot; and handed him 
                  a business card. I still have a business card of hers with that 
                  original data. Her name was Hildegard Knies. Her father was, 
                  unfortunately, a big Nazi, but the daughter the reverse. As 
                  is so often the case, children will do the reverse of their 
                  parents. That is whom we called in desperation. And she said, 
                  &quot;Let me send you to Doctor Elizabeth Abek,&quot; who was 
                  prior to that time fired by the Nazi's from the university as 
                  a philosophy teacher teaching the wrong philosophy.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The philosophy 
                  professor was pensioned early and was running a quiet little 
                  underground operation for Jews. We don't know how many, and 
                  we don't know who it was, and in some cases we found out in 
                  1948 when we came back to Berlin long after the war was over 
                  and we'd been in Russia for almost 4 years as captives of the 
                  Russians. Another regime. We only know that a dress was provided 
                  for my mother, some money was provided for the two of them. 
                  They were given an address and sent off, and I was taken elsewhere. 
                  They said it was too obvious-a man, a woman and a child. And 
                  in my case, the philosophy student, Hilde Knies, took me and 
                  I was to say I was bombed out, or she would tell people I was 
                  an illegitimate child of a fellow students of Humbolt, because 
                  Hitler, after all endorsed Kraft durch Freude-Pleasure through 
                  free act-and rewarded people for being lovers, so even that 
                  was good. But of course, it was dangerous to keep someone like 
                  me. I would stay at some people's house I remember, in fact 
                  the people-another student-who took me also for a few days, 
                  and I said to the student's mother when she took me along to 
                  go grocery shopping, &quot;Ohgg, you're buying milk. We're not 
                  allowed to buy milk.&quot; She didn't know it was me, because 
                  her daughter had made up a story, of course, about me. Or, one 
                  day we shopped and, this wasn't too far from where we lived 
                  in Berlin, which is now Marburgerstrasse12, and I stopped and 
                  said, &quot;Well look at that. That house isn't bombed. We didn't 
                  get bombed out. Our house is right here.&quot; And the women 
                  again looked at me, and came home and said, &quot;That's it. 
                  Get that child out of here. There's something strange with that 
                  child. Wait until your father finds out.&quot; Mr. Top Nazi 
                  number 2! &quot;We've got to get rid of this kid. There's something 
                  strange&quot;</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So, I went 
                  to a woman doctor. The woman doctor, I believe had a child that 
                  had died and her husband was in the service, and she said, &quot;I'll 
                  take this child if I can baptize her. There will be no heathen 
                  over my doorsteps.&quot; Ok, baptize. So I have a reservation 
                  in several heavens by now. There, the problem erupted, she said, 
                  &quot;Now you must say your prayers when you go to sleep.&quot; 
                  In fact, I have a picture of myself on her balcony. I prayed 
                  the only little prayer I knew, which was a simple little Jewish 
                  thing, Hebrew thing. And she immediately rang up the people 
                  who had brought me there and said, &quot;Get that child out 
                  of here, it prays in some gibberish words that I can't understand. 
                  I don't know what language it is. But something is suspicious 
                  about this child, despite its blond hair and blue eyes.&quot; 
                  That made people eager to take me, of course. But, apparently 
                  I had a mouth that was similar to my father's. An active mouth 
                  to this day. And so it was. I'd be on the streetcar with my 
                  mother and with one of the students and some Gestapo person 
                  would come over and pick me up and hold me up and say, &quot;The 
                  epitome of the perfect German child.&quot; Because in looks 
                  I matched everything and I was easy to hide. I was not a boy. 
                  Jewish boys, of course, were circumcised. </font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Other Germans 
                  were not circumcised until probably the 1950's, when it became 
                  a health matter. It wasn't for ritual reasons the way Jews did. 
                  Since I'm finding out that other groupings-Middle Easterners 
                  do circumcision, and even in Africa, do circumcision at age 
                  15 for men, I think. Just read it. So, we got along. My parents 
                  got along, but I never really saw them but for 5 or 10 minutes. 
                  I really didn't know what had happened to them. I didn't know 
                  I was a Jew. I didn't know what a Jew was. And I didn't know 
                  what that was until my mother told me in mid-January, 1945, 
                  and the last place we were hiding, at that time together. We 
                  were not, of course, always together. I was sent away separate 
                  from my parents by these various persons who were active in 
                  trying to save individuals. There were maybe about 13 people 
                  saved by this small grouping of professor and students-women 
                  students. There were no men. Men were in the service.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I was sent 
                  to East Prussia to a family to be taken care of, who only had 
                  the wife there. The father of the family was a Lutheran or Evangelical 
                  pastor. He was at the Russian frond tending to soldiers. He'd 
                  been drafted in that capacity. The woman had three boys of various 
                  ages. She knew about me, but only she. This was a castle that 
                  belonged to a Baroness. It was called a castle, it was really 
                  just a three-story mansion. And the 1997 calendar of the Washington 
                  D.C. Museum has a picture of that, and refers to it as a castle. 
                  Slightly exaggerated. It was probably an Estate. What we called 
                  an Estate. Huge, huge. And there I existed. I presume my mother 
                  and father must have died, or everybody gets shipped off to 
                  somewhere when they're six years old or five years old. And 
                  one day my mother reappeared there on the front steps. I couldn't 
                  believe it. I couldn't believe it. But I really wasn't interested 
                  in her anymore. So much had happened that I was kind of catatonic 
                  in my behavior. Just kind of numb. It had been probably eight, 
                  nine months. But I never heard from her, and I had no way to 
                  know. </font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Plus, she 
                  was battling the bombs in Berlin, had died her hair to avoid 
                  being detected. We also never had fake papers. Some people had 
                  money and bought fake papers, but we had nothing like that. 
                  So we would be arrested, for instance, just for not having any 
                  papers. That's enough to get you into a police station regarding 
                  you identity. Everything was checked. Everything was&#133;..And 
                  it was all done manually without the use of the kind of equipment 
                  we have today that tracks people right and left. It's easier 
                  today. You had to report a change of residence within 3 days 
                  in Berlin at that time, and still do to this day at your local 
                  police station. You just don't take off for somewhere. There's 
                  no such thing. My father was pretty good during the time they 
                  were still together, at faking his way through. He would go 
                  into some place and say, &quot;Hey, I'm a soldier on furlough 
                  and I'm here with my girlfriend and we'd like a room. I'll give 
                  you some extra money and in a few days I'll get you the ID papers 
                  you need. I just don't have all of that with me.&quot; That 
                  worked for them for a while. Because, you see, there were no 
                  men walking around. This man was 42-43 years old. There were 
                  no men walking around who were not in uniform in 1943. And that 
                  was precisely what cost him. He was arrested eventually in the 
                  middle of a street.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I remember 
                  visiting once in a place they had rented, like a little pension, 
                  a little B&amp;B, where he had rented a room. Talked his way 
                  into it. They also would have cake and coffee in Hitler's brother's 
                  caf&eacute; in the middle of the busiest part of Berlin, because 
                  he reasoned that there they would not look for Jews. Because 
                  there were catchers, and some were people like Stella-called 
                  the &quot;blond poison&quot; who was promised to become &quot;Arianized&quot;-have 
                  her Jewish expunged after the War if she would help them now 
                  to catch the people who were hiding. Stella Goldschlag was Jewish, 
                  married to a Jew. And the two of them were dressed to the teeth, 
                  well fed, and each was allowed a revolver on their person and 
                  could arrest anyone.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Hitler's 
                  brother was named Aloise. He had a caf&eacute; right on the 
                  busiest part. Who knows, it was probably a half-brother. I have 
                  friends who have papers signed by Himler's brother. Apparently, 
                  people had brothers and they happened to have the same initials 
                  as the #1, 2, or 3 man like that and could use that as a means 
                  for saving people sometimes. Somebody else would say, &quot;Hey, 
                  sign this document, I need this document&quot;&#133;So the brother 
                  of such a person had powers he wasn't even aware of to prevent 
                  say a draft or being forced into Gestapo partisanship or something 
                  like that, if you wanted to be exempt.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">My mother 
                  and father living underground. I have to go back about them 
                  living together. My father goes off answering an ad for laundry. 
                  They went back into the attic and stole back things they had 
                  to leave there, and things in their apartment that had to be 
                  left there because the SS seal was over that. The Gestapo seal, 
                  I should say. But they carefully lifted that and replaced it 
                  by just taking among other things an old pair of work pants 
                  into which they had sewn some money. That held them over for 
                  a while. Who would pick up old, ripped work pants. It was garbage. 
                  The linens that they stole they knew they would be able to sell 
                  just to sustain themselves, and they did that. Not to burden 
                  the people who were helping them. It was enough if they could 
                  help find places when it was needed. My father had answered 
                  an ad to sell some of this laundry, and the Gestapo had placed 
                  tricky ads in there to catch people precisely like them. They'd 
                  have to get money from somewhere. And so in this case, when 
                  they went out there on a summer night, they had cancelled once 
                  before on intuition. Something didn't feel right, and had gone 
                  three weeks later, when my mother remembered what that phone 
                  number was about that he had in his pocket. He called it again, 
                  made an appointment, they went there. It was this beautiful 
                  summer day, end of June, and 1943. And in no time another plainclothesman 
                  crosses the street. He's going into the building at an angle. 
                  The other man crosses at a different angle so that they meet 
                  up at the front door of this apartment building in a community 
                  named Zehlendorf in Berlin. We lived there eventually. My mother 
                  suddenly remembered where she was on what street and we had 
                  to move. She couldn't live there. That's where he was captured.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">He goes 
                  into the building with that man. Another man materializes from 
                  somewhere, and in short, they've got him. They come down a half-hour 
                  later from, apparently the apartment they'd been to. The whole 
                  thing was a trap. And they had him between them as they walked 
                  down the street. And my mother, who had been coached not to 
                  give away what was happening-that she was related to him or 
                  anything-heard him say, &quot;Well, I live at..&quot; and he 
                  named off some fake address, which to her meant you stay away 
                  from here and from this situation. But she followed them all 
                  the way with a bus that they'd jumped on to. He managed in the 
                  crowded bus to slip her the satchel that he had with all of 
                  the linens in it. One of those big, old-fashioned, tick briefcases. 
                  And they didn't even notice that he had handed her that. That 
                  was the last time she saw him. The next thing she heard he was 
                  held in custody and, of course, what they do at the police station 
                  is, &quot;who are you, where's your ID&quot;&#133;He had none. 
                  We had burned our Jewish ID; you might as well have none, as 
                  that. The next thing is drop your pants. Ahh, what have we here, 
                  a Jew that hasn't been deported with the last action, the end 
                  of February. That was supposed to clean out all the Jews from 
                  Berlin. So we had escaped to that point. And we know that he 
                  attempted 3 escapes from light duty, because they wanted him 
                  to tell where my mother was, where I was. They know all this 
                  about you. They know everything down to your great grandparents 
                  on this ID system. All she knows is that on August 4th there 
                  is another transport-one of the few left-leaving from a train 
                  station in Berlin.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So my father 
                  is designated to be on that transport August 4, 1943, direct 
                  to Auschwitz. My mother hears about this through somebody who 
                  knows of another transport. And she rushes out there to the 
                  platform, as if she can save him. Well that would be the regular 
                  train, not the cattle cars that they've been taking these people 
                  in, which was on a whole different (train chassis). Way far 
                  in the distance she can see a few people standing there. I think 
                  it's a transport that only had 99 or 100 people on it as I learned 
                  from books recently, when I visited the DC museum I found out 
                  about that transport finally. And we know the transport arrived 
                  August 5, the next day, boiling hot summer day, and that likely 
                  when that arrived, because he had no assigned number, no tattoo 
                  number which Auschwitz people got on arrival from the outside, 
                  you did not receive a number if you were a transfer in.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Well it 
                  turned out that he had no number, he was a short man with dark, 
                  curly hair, glasses, 42-43 years old, oh, give that man half 
                  an hour, that's about how long it was for the gas chamber, and 
                  I just today in a short story read again that people who were 
                  not sharp enough to take off their glasses when they arrived 
                  at Auschwitz would find themselves in the left, to the gas chambers, 
                  immediately. So we know from that that's what happened. He was 
                  already, German Jews hadn't seen good food since the Nuremberg 
                  Laws were enacted, so they looked pretty emaciated at a fairly 
                  early age. A lot of black market buying had to occur to sustain 
                  yourself. I grew up without milk, without meat, without fresh 
                  fruit. Somehow you grow up. Maybe that's why at 61 I have more 
                  health problems recently, I don't know, maybe not. </font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(Regarding 
                  not taking glasses off): He didn't know, he didn't have the 
                  savvy, he was a white collar man. Blue collar workers, people 
                  coming from Poland, were savvy survivor types, under their own 
                  countries' regimes. They were never citizens like we were in 
                  our country. German Jews were citizens of Germany until their 
                  citizenship was removed, revoked, and they were much sharper 
                  from those other countries. </font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Another 
                  fairly ignorant group, I understand, were Greek Jews. They had 
                  no clue what was going on when they would arrive at camps. Simply 
                  because they didn't speak any other language. You know, most 
                  Europeans speak another, maybe even a third language. Greek 
                  Jews could barely read and write. They were utterly poverty-struck 
                  as long as anyone can remember, lived on dirt floors, very very 
                  poor, very unskilled. You had to say things like &quot;Yes, 
                  I'm an electrician.&quot; My father didn't know about those 
                  things, you know. Most German Jews were not blue collar people, 
                  they simply were middle class and upper middle class people 
                  and more, in many cases. So we wouldn't have known to take our 
                  glasses off, that that could be your death sentence. We weren't 
                  even sure about people being killed in those places. A little 
                  rumble was heard here and there: It isn't just about work, they 
                  may be killing our people in some of these places. Oh, but not 
                  in a country like Germany. </font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And you 
                  notice the death camps were never on German soil. The regime 
                  was afraid that the German population would rebel at that. It 
                  sounded too insane. But you could pull it off in Poland or Czechoslovakia 
                  perhaps, some other countries, where they didn't understand 
                  all that was being said. So we know that he probably was gassed 
                  within half an hour to an hour. He had told my mother: If I 
                  ever land in such a place, and if what we suspect is true, then 
                  he would go to the electric fence. They had heard that people 
                  were kept penned up in an electric fence system, so they couldn't 
                  escape. But the conditions were nothing like what a civilized 
                  mind could imagine, nothing. So if he hadn't tried to go to 
                  the electric fence-and he would have been shot in the back on 
                  the way-he would have been annihilated. And friends of mine 
                  have confirmed that who were from Berlin, men who survived who 
                  were young teenagers at the time, friends of my mother's sister. 
                  No one really survived any of this except my mother and me. 
                  Her sister wound up being, after their mutual father died of 
                  malnutrition and pestilence and scabies and everything else, 
                  neglect and hunger in Terazin, Terezenstat, her husband and 
                  she were separately shipped to Auschwitz. By the time she got 
                  to Auschwitz he was gassed already, having worked in a quarry 
                  for about six weeks, that's as long as the people lasted in 
                  the quarry called Golleschau; I've had the good fortune to find 
                  all this out in the last three years. So she had gone to Auschwitz 
                  by herself and, from Auschwitz to Bergen-Belsen on foot, there 
                  was I think a January of 1945 march, on which, I don't know, 
                  9/10 of the people died on these marches. </font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And how 
                  do I know all this? I found a woman in England who married a 
                  British serviceman right after the liberation in Bergen-Belsen 
                  and she was a student nurse together with my mother's sister. 
                  She saw her about four weeks before the liberation in Bergen-Belsen. 
                  She had just come on a later transport than my father, as it 
                  turned out, far later at the last minute, was caught with her 
                  young son, who was the same age that I was at the time, born 
                  in the same hospital where both my aunt was a nurse and this 
                  boy's mother was a nurse by then, and she spoke to my mother's 
                  sister, gave her all this information, and said I can't do this 
                  anymore, everyone is dead, my husband's dead, my father's dead, 
                  my sister and little Evchen, that would be me, and my father, 
                  and everyone that had meaning to her. She was at that time, 
                  I should tell you, 22 years old, and life was over.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Another 
                  friend of mine saw her, he lived in Chicago now, he was the 
                  same age she was, he was a patient at the time in the hospital 
                  when it was liquidated, and he had would up directly in Auschwitz 
                  because he became well again after his surgery, of course. And 
                  my grandfather was only sent with his family to that better 
                  camp because he was a World War One decorated veteran. In fact, 
                  many of our family members on my mother's side had all been 
                  veterans of several different wars of Germany. We were assimilated 
                  Jews, that is, just like in America, people come here and become 
                  assimilated. When people ask who are you you say you're an American. 
                  What religion are you? Jewish. You don't say what country and 
                  identity do you have, you don't say Jewish, you say German or 
                  whatever country you're from. Well in many countries Jews were 
                  not of that country but just Jews, because they were never made 
                  citizens the way we had been. </font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This was 
                  a real blow to people who had been veterans and had served. 
                  Think of yourself here in America. You're an American, you may 
                  be Catholic, Jewish, Episcopal, Methodist, Lutheran, Baptist, 
                  I don't know, whatever all religions, and suddenly you're put 
                  away, and someone says oh we don't care if you were loyal, and 
                  you served in the Korean War or World War Two, in the recent 
                  Gulf War or whatever, it doesn't matter. It matters only that 
                  we don't Catholics or Methodists or whatever, and there you 
                  are. That's what it was like for my grandfather. Now my father 
                  didn't fit into any war, but his brother served in World War 
                  One. He had, however, gone to America, to San Francisco, early, 
                  and had been lucky that way, but never did have a way to sponsor 
                  our family (to emigrate), it was all too late. So my grandfather 
                  on Mom's side had a terrible shock, really never got over that, 
                  they thought it was all just a temporary insanity. You know, 
                  every old person thought the same thing, it'll go away soon. 
                  Every aristocrat in Germany thought the same thing. </font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Catholics 
                  tended not to be Nazis because they put God before a leader 
                  of their country in that loyalty, that hierarchy is different. 
                  Under Hitler, you put Hitler on the top, family and all that 
                  comes perhaps next, and then comes God, so you've scrambled 
                  up all the hierarchy of what matters, what you serve and whom 
                  you serve. In fact, in German I remember boys turning in their 
                  own families, can you imagine the tragedy of children my age 
                  playing &quot;Abholen&quot; -- &quot;Abholen&quot; in German 
                  means to pick up, or make that, round up. So that's what that 
                  word was that had developed under the Nazi regime at least in 
                  Berlin, and so we children from the Jewish kindergarten where 
                  children were picked up regularly, would play &quot;Apolen&quot;, 
                  and on a Sunday when my friends and their parents came to visit 
                  my parents, the only day off they had, we'd say okay, let's 
                  play &quot;Apolen&quot; and I'll be the Gestapo and you be the 
                  people that we're gonna pick up. In Auschwitz, people played 
                  that, I read that, children played insane games like that. Reality 
                  becomes the game that you play, if you can imagine. We did use 
                  fake names when we lived illegally and underground, like parents 
                  had coached me and said your name's not Goldstein -- Holstein 
                  -- because a province in Germany, a type of cow variety here, 
                  Holstein. And I kept saying, no, no, and my father kept saying 
                  you will do what I tell you. And I remember at play once in 
                  one of the hiding places where my mother happened to be also, 
                  in Prussia, she was talking to a Nazi woman whose husband had 
                  been instrumental in rescuing Mussolini, who was temporarily 
                  kidnapped by Allies, and he participated in the retrieval of 
                  Mussolini, and this was his wife and their two children, I ran 
                  up in play in the sandbox and said to my mother &quot;I must 
                  whisper, I must whisper to you.&quot; </font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Of course, 
                  whispering is rude, we're the country of good manners, remember, 
                  you don't whisper in front of another person, and the woman 
                  felt sorry for me and she said that's okay, she said to my mother, 
                  let her whisper. And I whispered, I still remember what I was 
                  wearing even, it's so real, I said can I just once say my real 
                  name, Goldstein? My mother paled and to this day uses that little 
                  finger and said &quot;Don't you ever say that word again.&quot; 
                  So this woman of course presumed I was uttering some four-letter 
                  word, and my mother made it sound exactly like that. But you 
                  had to be fast on your feet, you had to be very fast, very fast-thinking. 
                  And of course I've been on alert all my life. Everything is 
                  an alert for me, too much so. </font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">My mother 
                  is still alive. The Russians were our liberators and it was 
                  a big disappointment. We knew nothing of Stalin policies but 
                  we have become expert on it, almost as good as the other systems. 
                  We were held with other civilian Germans and military Italians 
                  in camps. First we were schlepped around with the front, the 
                  Russian front, advancing toward the west. They kept all of us 
                  with them, we had to walk, the front, in January. In fact Solzeneitzen 
                  came and liberated that part of Germany that we were in, East 
                  Prussia, his particular platoon that he was in, in the Russian 
                  Army. </font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And the 
                  Russians were something else. One cannot always be prepared 
                  for what comes. Not only was it all primitive, there was a language 
                  problem, we wanted to try to save the people with whom we had 
                  last stayed and they wouldn't listen to us. In fact they said 
                  we weren't really Jews, they had told my mother &quot;All Jews 
                  kaput!&quot; And my mother said no, no, no, that's not true. 
                  They said yes, all Jews kaput -- they were right. Two out of 
                  three German Jews were exterminated during that Holocaust. Imagine 
                  if three people are sitting there and only one of you survives. 
                  That's what it meant. At least as best they know from the figures. 
                  </font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Well they 
                  detained us and my mother wasn't going to give in to a regime 
                  that was as murderous as the other one. When they said to her 
                  &quot;You go out there into the camp and listen and name us, 
                  I don't know, ten German Nazis every week, and then we'll take 
                  good care of you and your daughter.&quot; She said I don't know 
                  these people, I can't do that, I don't know if they're Nazis. 
                  She said you name ten people or Sirbihutsis, which means do 
                  you want Siberia? So we became acquainted with that whole insanity 
                  of what went on in the Stalin era. And we didn't know the Stalin 
                  order was &quot;If it speaks German, looks German, and acts 
                  German it is German. Do not fall for anything. When in doubt, 
                  shoot.&quot; My mother nearly got herself killed trying to explain 
                  who we were. It was chaos, they were very simple people from 
                  the outermost Russian regions, we all watch enough TV to know 
                  that not everything is New York and Paris on this planet. Primitive 
                  people, the most primitive that you could imagine, were sent 
                  out at the early front. People from Outer Mongolia. Hey they 
                  don't even ask questions after they kill. Kill first, ask no 
                  questions ever, move on. So we had a very bad time, so to me 
                  the more physical threatening stuff really goes with that part 
                  of what came after. By then I was seven. Hey I've made it to 
                  seven! And eventually the Russians dragged us around enough 
                  that my mother dug her way out of the barbed wire, gave her 
                  last piece of jewelry to a Russian soldier. </font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You have 
                  to know that the Russians treated their own people no better 
                  than the prisoners. Their own people were starving as well. 
                  We all know that now. You know, those Siberian cities were built 
                  by Russian prisoners, under the Stalin regime. They weren't 
                  built as free enterprise projects, you know. Today you hear 
                  oh beautiful city in Siberia. They forget how many lives that 
                  took of their very own people. They also hated Jews, that was 
                  beside the point, they also had that condemning of Jews to Siberia, 
                  plenty of stories have now been told after the fact, so we were 
                  living illegally and found ourselves next thing in Vilna. Used 
                  to be when I said Vilna, I was in a Jewish orphanage in Vilna, 
                  they'd say where is Vilna. </font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Well thank 
                  heavens that the (Iron) Curtain has come down and people now 
                  know that it's the capital of Lithuania. And it was a very modern 
                  city prior to the war. And so she kept me there while she worked 
                  for some Jewish Russian woman judge. She had to send up 100 
                  people a week to Siberia to meet the workforce out there. So 
                  on trumped-up charges people were condemned there. My world 
                  was so upside-down that all rights were wrongs, you have to 
                  realize, and all wrongs were right. Criminality ruled. If you 
                  had a straight person in a straight mind and an honest character, 
                  there was no place for you in either regime. And of course my 
                  mother said we're going back to Germany, there's three repatriation 
                  trains, I have to get away from the NKVD, they keep calling 
                  me for interrogation, tell us more Nazis, we don't care, what 
                  they did or if they're real, tell us more Nazis. </font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Article 
                  58, something like that. Solzeneitzen can teach you about that 
                  regime, you just read a book called One Day in the Life of Ivan 
                  Denisovich and you will have understood that system. So we were 
                  pretty mixed up. We did get on a cattle train and I'm sure it 
                  was the same cattle train, it was just hosed out once. We went 
                  back with fellow Germans who did not become friendly to Jews 
                  you understand, overnight. They still felt that everything was 
                  our fault, whatever happened. And we were on a train that was 
                  loaded with typhus. And of course when there was a stop and 
                  they would open the outer doors, we would throw the deceased 
                  people right out of the train, so we were in an infected train. 
                  </font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We had no 
                  food, people drank locomotive oil to have something to drink, 
                  just bizarre things. Somebody stole my coat, I had a coat somebody 
                  had handmade out of a blanket, stole it off my body while I 
                  was daring to fall asleep, by now I'm ten years old, I'd been 
                  in various places with my mother and a Jewish orphanage, the 
                  war has been over for three years and we're still not home. 
                  She said wait til we get home. And of course before the Russians 
                  had come she sat me on her lap and said I want you to know why 
                  all this is happening. And of course my answer was all what? 
                  I thought this is life. This is life, this is how it works. 
                  People often ask weren't you scared, well scared of what? Isn't 
                  this how all life is? You just presume it's like this. She said 
                  well we're Jews and this and that and I said what is it? Is 
                  it bigger than a breadbox or what? I had no clue, I had no clue 
                  about religions. I didn't even know when my birthday was, I 
                  was ten years old. So she said well we'll get back to Berlin 
                  and our family will be there and that's why we have to get back 
                  to Germany, away from these eastern European countries, we cannot 
                  live here, this is not our kind of life and culture. </font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">By then 
                  she had understood the Stalin system. And we were put in quarantine 
                  with our little train, and again the same people who had helped 
                  us sent us train tickets to there, and again we escaped without 
                  benefit of that health certificate. If we hadn't gotten typhus 
                  by now, we were fortunate to be immune to it. So back to Berlin, 
                  and by now it's the end of 1948. Other people have already celebrated 
                  the end of the war, have gotten back on their feet, and we're 
                  just arriving. And of course nobody was there for us. In fact 
                  we couldn't even get good data until, as I mentioned earlier, 
                  lastly here in the last few years, did I know my mother's sister 
                  died in Bergen Belsen.</font></p>

                  Another paternal grandfather. This is where I stayed with the 
                  German doctor who had to baptize me, and I was playing with

                  it says on the back. During the underground time. And that's 
                  why it was hard to find a child like me out. That was in East 
                  Prussia with the people I was staying with. That picture is 
                  pretty dead. It's about had it. It's an enlargement. Different

                  Jews. I think for a single person, my mother talked hatefully

                  may not know he or she are doing something good. She would get 
                  information from her Nazi contacts. We didn't know they were 
                  giving her information. She was teaching philosophy to German
