          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jim Terr &copy; 2010 <em>(DRAFT)</em> <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(using my &quot;Silverado&quot; song track as I did <a href="http://www.bluecanyonproductions.com/music/Ballad_of_Devil_Weed.mp3">here</a>)</p>
        <p>&lsquo;Twas ten o'clock on election eve and the folks were gathered  round<br />
          The TV as we humans do to see what&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; down.<br />
          When a rush of ads and infomercials sealed the ruination.<br />
          Of the candidate with a healthy fear of corporate  domination.</p>
        <p>It seems he fathered an illegal alien a couple years ago<br />
          And the socialists and gays and Muslims give him all his  dough.<br />
          And he really wants to tax you to death and to kill your  granny too.<br />
          It&rsquo;s sayin that on the teevee so by God it must be true.</p>
        <p><em>Thank God for the  Supreme Court, a modest and high-minded sort,</em><br />
            <em>Never would rule us  from the bench, hit us with a monkey wrench, </em><br />
            <em>Except when it comes  to appointing a president for democratic nation.</em><br />
            <em>Or handing elections  over, now, to monster corporations.&nbsp; </em></p>
        <p>Yeah, these justices respect whatever the Founders had in  mind<br />
          Except the part &lsquo;bout keeping corporations very much in  line.<br />
          They used to be limited partnerships with a very limited reach<br />
          And now by God they&rsquo;re people with tender feelings and free  speech.</p>
        <p>Yeah, to put it in its simplest terms ... etc... <em>CHORUS </em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>OTHER SONG IN PROGRESS </strong>- reggae style probably<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="style3">&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>This focuses on the importance of electing people who will not appoint out-of-it right-wing judges to the Court - since that how this happens of course) </em></span></p>
        <p>(Chorus) Pull the plug on the people<br />
          Who pack the Court with stooges<br />
          Who bolster up the scrooges... <br />
          Who simply want it all.</p>
        <p><em>(etc.. - yeah I know, I'm such a Bolshevik - sorry) </em></p>

  <p><em><strong>Finally, not on this topic specifically,</strong> but only because Jim Bohannon's suggestion and title<br />
    resulted in my writing this song, which he loves and would be very prone to play on his<br />
    national show, and which could catch on in any event - and has a good point. Might do this<br />
    IF I have surplus funds, after the above 2 on the topic of the day.</em></p>

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jim  Terr &copy; 2010</p>
        <p align="left">Grandpa was a fount of wisdom, &lsquo;least we assumed he was. <br />
          A man&rsquo;s look can impress you more than what he says or does. <br />
          And Grandpa waited patiently til one day we got stuck<br />
          On the question of why God would bring on earthquakes, fires  and floods..</p>
        <p align="left">We looked to Grandpa to explain how God could be so cruel,<br />
          So Gramps explained how the Lord could level churches, homes  and schools:<br />
          <em>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s just trying to  amuse Himself, the best that He is able.</em><br />
          <em>Cuz that stuff&rsquo;s so  entertaining, and Heaven don&rsquo;t have cable.&rdquo;</em></p>
        <p align="left">A silence fell on those assembled, and Grandpa didn&rsquo;t peep<br />
          As we took him to his bedroom, tucked him in and off to  sleep.<br />
          We fiddled with his medication, sure that was the problem,<br />
          The downers and uppers in shapes and colors that made you  wanna gobble &lsquo;em.</p>
        <p align="left">So Grandpa mellowed out, in fact to the opposite extreme.<br />
          He smiled and laughed so much it almost made you wanna  scream.<br />
          To the question posed the previous week he had a new reply:<br />
          <em>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s God&rsquo;s will and  it must be right. Don&rsquo;t question how or why.&rdquo;</em></p>
        <p align="left"><em>&hellip;and then he smiled  with that all-knowing grin that just made you wanna smack him&hellip;</em></p>
        <p align="left">Well, we decided medication maybe wasn&rsquo;t it.<br />
          Natural foods and supplements might be a better fit. <br />
          We loaded him up on veggies, juices, tinctures, herbs and tonics.<br />
          And for good measure a Thai Massage and a vinegar colonic. </p>
        <p align="left">And having reached his equilibrium Grandpa&rsquo;s mind was clear.<br />
          He patiently explained that though the end may not be near,<br />
          We nonetheless can only guess that God might be most pleased<br />
          If we treat each other with kindness, like we&rsquo;re all one  family.<br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>&hellip;since we are&hellip;are we not?</em></p>
