        <p class="style14">SOME INTERESTING THOUGHTS ON SATIRE</p>
        <p><strong>BEN  FRANKLIN...<br />
            <br />
        </strong>He was a funny writer,  with a . . . taste for pseudonymous pranks; he hid his most ascerbic opinions  behind the masks of made-up characters. But he had world-class ambitions, and  he understood that these ambitions were probably best served by achievement . .  . <br />
        <br />
...he understood that he would inevitably be viewed as a provincial, and that  it paid to play the clown a little . . .The metropolis, while it mistrusts an  upstart, forgives a lovable provincial eccentric.<br />
<br />
Franklin liked to write letters claiming to be from other people . . . <span class="style15">in order  to dramatize some political point through obvious overload</span>. The last thing he  wrote was a letter purportedly from a Muslim slaver . . . whose lust for  slavery was intended to hold a mirror up to the American slaveholder's own, and  shame him.<br />
<br />
<strong>Franklin was an instinctive ironist . . . it was his natural mode . . . the  whole thing depended on being reported with an absolutely straight face.</strong> It was  not that he did not value honesty . . . He would have been reluctant to say  something that he believed to be a lie. But, as a businessman and a writer and  a diplomat, he might very well be willing to dramatize, or even overdramatize,  something he believed to be essentially the truth.<br />
<br />
Franklin's essentially ironic, distancing turn of mind . . . gave him a kind of  second sight into the minds of his hosts. There is little sham in French life,  but a lot of show, a lot of rhetorical gesturing. Franklin understood this  style instantly. He was pretending to be a naif . . ., which the French knew to  be faux, and they were pretending to be worldly, which he knew to be an  illusion.<br />
<br />
But the logic of power depends largely on the perceptions, the feelings, of the  people who have it. Franklin understood that, above all, the good opinion of  the French mattered. It paid to be liked and admired, and he made sure that he  was. He knew that he could not make his country, and its needs, inescapable if  he did not make himself, and his cause, irresistable.<br />

            <p>Source: (Boston satirical  political art exhibit at Art Institute of Boston)</p>
            <p><a href="http://www.tfaoi.com/aa/2aa/2aa323.htm">http://www.tfaoi.com/aa/2aa/2aa323.htm</a> <br />
              &quot;Mightier than the Sword, Political  Satire, Caricature, and Cartoon on the Presidency, Presidents and Presidential  Elections&quot; opens at The Art Institute of Boston at Lesley University, 700  Beacon Street, on Monday, November 13, 2000 and continues through January 21,  2001. <br />
              The exhibition highlights the work of artists Edward Sorel of <em>The New  Yorker</em>, Jules Feiffer of the <em>Village Voice</em>, Robert Grossman of <em>The  Atlantic Monthly</em>, Seymour Chwast of Push Pin Studios in New York City, Jeff  Danziger of <em>The Los Angeles Times</em> and Dan Wasserman of <em>The Boston  Globe</em>.<br />
              &quot;Those engaged in the profession of political satire and cartoon,  whatever their own political views, are the prime exemplars of freedom of the  press,&quot; explains curator Bonnell Robinson. In 1830, the French government  fueled a revolution, in part, because they tried to suppress visual satire and  caricature. Among those who survived -- to attack again -- was Honor&eacute; Daumier.  Today, Feiffer, Sorel, Danziger, Chwast, Wasserman, and Grossman are among our  finest masters of satire and cartoon to continue this tradition of political  commentary - -as they unmask and lampoon the foibles and follies of our  politicians.&quot;<br />
              Jon Swan, author and journalist, in his introduction to the exhibition  brochure writes, &quot;While satire is first and foremost a literary form, the  impulse to puncture and deflate, to indict and excoriate finds expression in  all the arts, particularly the pictorial. Hogarth's &quot;The Rake's Progress,&quot;  is a memorable example; Daumier's depictions elf predatory lawyers and a  generally avaricious bourgeois society have lost neither their relevance nor  their bite. While written satire may be gasping its last -- a washed-up shark  still snapping its jaws -- the impulse that gave us a rich literature of wrath  and righteous indignation lives on in the work of such masterful practitioners  as Ronald Searle, David Levine, Edward Sorel and Arnold Roth. It should be  noted, however, that, fewer and fewer magazines care to, or dare to, showcase  satirical artwork. It might offend!&quot;<br />
              Jeff Danziger's motto is &quot;the world is too serious not  to laugh at it.&quot;</p>
            <p>Edward Sorel (born 1929) once said, &quot;I wake up angry  and go to sleep angry. Essentially, my cartoons are a kind of therapy to keep  myself from going crazy at the insanity and injustice in the world.&quot;</p>
