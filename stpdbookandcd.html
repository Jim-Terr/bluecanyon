&quot;Jim's songs, sung in a clear simple style, are not only a perfect passport to learning American English, but also to understanding American culture.  His songs explore humanity and everyday life with affection and insight.  I highly recommend Jim's body of work as a enjoyable portal to American spirit and speech.&quot;<br />

        <p class="style9">MUSIC</p>
        <p>As a  record producer, he has been closely associated with &ldquo;outlaw&rdquo; country  singer/songwriter <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Young_(musician)">Steve  Young</a>, writer of the song, &ldquo;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Bridges_Road"><em>Seven Bridges Road</em></a>&rdquo;,  recorded by The Eagles, Joan Baez, Dolly Parton, Rita Coolidge and others, and <em>&quot;Lonesome, On'ry and Mean&quot;</em> recorded by Waylon Jennings; &nbsp;<a href="http://www.kathychiavola.com/">Kathy  Chiavola</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junior_Brown">Junior Brown</a> (as &ldquo;J.

        <p>That  album, released under Terr&rsquo;s Blue   Canyon label, contained a  version of the classic song, &ldquo;<em>Desperados Waiting for a Train</em>,&rdquo; which writer <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_Clark">Guy Clark</a> called his favorite  version of the song, and which was later featured on a Rhino Records  compilation. The album also contained two songs written by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinky_Friedman">Kinky Friedman</a>, and one  of the first recorded compositions by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Earle">Steve Earle</a>. Also among earlierst producer of songs by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butch_Hancock">Butch Hancock</a> and <a href="https://store.cdbaby.com/Artist/DavidHalley1">David Halley</a>. </p>
        <p>His  1974 re-release of Steve Young&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Bridges_Road_(album)">Seven Bridges  Road</a>&rdquo; album, purchased from Reprise Records, gained sales and critical  acclaim sufficient to mark the last time Warner/Reprise ever sold the rights to  an album outright. </p>
        <p>Many  of Terr&rsquo;s early satires in the 1980s were featured on the&nbsp; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Demento" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Demento">Doctor Demento</a> national  radio program, later on such programs as Paul Harvey News, G. Gordon Liddy, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_Stage" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_Stage">Mountain Stage</a>, and the  ABC, CBS, NBC and NPR networks; and later (to present) on the Thom Hartmann and  Jim Bohannon radio shows. His  1994 novelty album, <a href="http://bluecanyonproductions.com/chicken.html" title="http://bluecanyonproductions.com/chicken.html">Chickenstock,</a> a Jewish parody of Woodstock, won some  national acclaim.<br />
          <br />
        He has worked closely with <strong>Tommy Hancock, Charlene Hancock, The Supernatural Family Band</strong> and <strong>Tejana Dames</strong>. </p>
        <p>His  CD releases of original material in <a href="http://bluecanyonproductions.com/cd.html">1999</a> and <a href="http://bluecanyonmusic.com/">2005</a> drew reviewer comparisons to <strong>Phil Ochs, Townes van Zandt, Loudon  Wainwright III, Tom T. Hall, Tom Lehrer, Mark Twain, Will Rogers, Jimmie Rodgers</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>and</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Jackie Mason, Shel Silverstein, Tom T. Hall, Bobby Bare,  Ray Stevens</strong> and <strong>Paul  Craft</strong>. He is a particular fan of the  songwriters Tom T. Hall and Bobby Braddock, having recorded several of their  songs on earlier albums.</p>
        <p>His alter-ego, crude country performer &ldquo;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhR5Hatwax0" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhR5Hatwax0">BuDDy</a>&rdquo;, has been  captured in several videos, and praised by such figures as humorist <strong>Dave Barry</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
        <p>As a  music publisher in the 1970s, Terr published songs recorded by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_Gentlemen">The Country Gentlemen</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hank_Williams_Jr">Hank Williams, Jr.</a>,  and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_Gayle">Crystal Gayle</a>. </p>

    <em>(first CD of original JT compositions after the &quot;...Stupid...&quot; collection) </em></p>
  <p>&quot;Some of&nbsp;<u>the&nbsp;<em>most thoroughly enjoyable</em>&nbsp;tunes</u>&nbsp;I've ever heard...tiny monuments to songwriting...For whatever elements came together to make the genius of Jim Terr and his music happen, we should be truly gleeful, grateful and gratified. 'Demos and Diamonds' is a square meal of music, a walk around town when all the lights are out and your first kiss, all over again.&quot;<br />

  <p><strong>New Mexico Singer/Songwriter Releases Debut CD after 27 Years in the Business!&nbsp;</strong><br />
    &nbsp; &nbsp; This is one of&nbsp;<u>the&nbsp;<em>most enjoyable albums</em></u>&nbsp;that I have listened to in ages. So country, so interesting and so entertaining. What more could one ask for from music?&nbsp;<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;	[Jim Terr has been] described as a modern day<strong>&nbsp;Mark Twain, Will Rogers, Jimmie Rodgers</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Jackie Mason</strong>&nbsp;rolled into one. Can I add to that list names like&nbsp;<strong>Shel Silverstein, Tom T. Hall, Bobby Bare, Ray Stevens</strong>&nbsp;and the likes--master wordsmiths all, and country boys too.<br />
    &nbsp; &nbsp;	This guy could quite easily make our stone country section on all counts. Yes, he is that good...this selection&nbsp;<em>barely scrapes the surface</em>&nbsp;of his huge talent...a killer songwriter and storyteller...<br />
    &nbsp; &nbsp; [&quot;Did It Hurt?&quot;] I just cannot stop laughing... [&quot;The Call&quot;] I find it most delightful as I do the whole album...<br />
    &nbsp; &nbsp;	...all of the guests give stellar performances...<br />

  <p><strong>A Late Starter!&nbsp;</strong><br />
    &nbsp; &nbsp; ...an impressive line-up of guest artists from New Mexico, California, Hawaii and Nashville. These include &quot;Bluegrass Vocalist of the Year&quot;&nbsp;<strong>Kathy Chiavola, Elvis</strong>&nbsp;impersonator Lonnie Yanes, the late western actor&nbsp;<strong>Slim Pickens</strong>, country music trucking star BuDDy Converse and the Sneakers, Sara Jo Rubenstein, and Lilia.<br />
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><em>-Country Music Round-Up (UK)</em></strong></p>
  <p><strong>Terr's CD spans parody, eye-opening sincerity</strong>&nbsp;<br />
    ...Terr produced an entire album by&nbsp;<strong>[Slim] Pickens</strong>, including the&nbsp;<strong>Guy Clark</strong>&nbsp;song Desperadoes Waiting for a Train--which Clark says is his favorite cover version of any of his tunes.<br />
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	My favorite tune [on the CD] is a recent one--Reader's Digest Me... There's not a speck of cynicism in this song, no hipster sneer or yuppie smirk...Terr's simple sincerity in this song and one about his father's death (The Call, 1986) is eye-opening.<br />
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	-Steve Terrell,&nbsp;<strong><em>Santa Fe New Mexican, &quot;Pasatiempo&quot;</em></strong></p>
  <p><strong><em>British Country Music Bulletin:</em></strong><br />
    &nbsp; &nbsp; An entertaining, description-defying collection... If one were to invite comparisons, you'd perhaps liken Jim Terr to&nbsp;<strong>Tom T. Hall</strong>, or, perhaps&nbsp;<strong>Paul Craft.</strong></p>

      &quot;In this world of computers, Starbucks and cell phones, I need what I once got from Haggard and Jones!&quot;</em><br />
    So declares the always entertaining, vastly underrated sing/songwriter from New Mexico Jim Terr on his latest CD, <em>SongZ 4 Sentimentalists</em>.<br />
  Twelve original numbres, ten of them penned by Jim, some of them <strong>funny, others poignant and downright tearjerking. </strong><br />
  I loved the lot and I'm not Jim's only admirer. He's received glowing praise from master tunesmiths <br />
