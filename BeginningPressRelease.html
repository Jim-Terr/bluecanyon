        <p><span class="style1"><strong>Santa Fe</strong><strong> Satirist  Tackles Feature-Length &ldquo;Mockumentary&rdquo; Form&nbsp; </strong></span></p>
        <p>As Santa Fe satirist, actor  and video producer Jim Terr nears half a million views on his YouTube channel  (&ldquo;hymiehymie&rdquo;), he is striking into feature-length territory with a parody of a  big-studio feature scheduled for release in October.</p>
        <p>Columbia  Pictures plans to release <em>&ldquo;The Social  Network,&rdquo;</em> a $49 million adaptation of a 2009 book about the founding of  Facebook, directed by David Fincher and co-starring Justin Timberlake.</p>
        <p>Terr&rsquo;s  satirical chord was touched by the idea of this &ldquo;tale of sex, money, genius and  betrayal&rdquo; (from the source book&rsquo;s subtitle), describing the founding of  Facebook, and he sketched out a parallel mockumentary about the founding of an  a imaginary social network based not on faces, but on another, almost-equally popular  part of the human anatomy. </p>
        <p>Terr&rsquo;s  film, to consist largely of staged &ldquo;interviews&rdquo; with key players, social  scientists and commentators about the history and impact of the imaginary  social networking website, is called <em>&ldquo;The  Beginning&rdquo;</em> ( <a href="http://www.beginningfilm.com/">www.BeginningFilm.com</a> ).</p>
        <p>Unlike <em>&ldquo;This is Spinal Tap,&rdquo;</em> the 1984 prototype  for the mockumentary form, Terr says his feature will avoid obvious comedy. &ldquo;I  want to make it so realistic that the viewer might wonder if there actually is  such a website they somehow never heard about,&rdquo; Terr says. &ldquo;We certainly have  enough good actors around here to pull this off, given a few &lsquo;talking points&rsquo; for  them to hit in their interviews.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>In addition  to <em>&ldquo;This is Spinal Tap&rdquo;</em>, Terr points  to other examples of the mockumentary form, such as Orson Welles&rsquo;  panic-inducing 1938 radio drama <em>&ldquo;War of  the Worlds,&rdquo;</em> 2009&rsquo;s acclaimed feature <em>&ldquo;Distict  9,&rdquo;</em> Woody Allen&rsquo;s <em>&ldquo;Zelig,&rdquo;</em> <em>&ldquo;Borat&rdquo;,</em> and, Terr says, one of the most  &ldquo;realistically&rdquo; misleading, Peter Jackson&rsquo;s <em>&ldquo;Forgotten  Silver,&rdquo;</em> the story of fictional New Zealand film pioneer Colin McKenzie. </p>
        <p>In addition  to a fascination with the almost-true in several short films and videos, Terr  has scored with several more conventional works, including his 2001 first  runner up in the Flicks on 66 competition, <em>&ldquo;The  Wrong Guy&rdquo;</em> (<a href="http://www.bluecanyonproductions.com/video/WrongGuy_2.wmv">http://www.bluecanyonproductions.com/video/WrongGuy_2.wmv</a> ) and a feature-length script, <em>&ldquo;The Home  of Katie Archer,&rdquo;</em> recorded as a radio drama with a cast of 40 actors at  KUNM-FM in Albuquerque (<a href="http://www.bluecanyonproductions.com/video/SAG_readings.wmv">http://www.bluecanyonproductions.com/video/SAG_readings.wmv</a> ).</p>
        <p>Among the  &ldquo;promo&rdquo; angles Terr anticipates as being useful when the <em>&ldquo;The Beginning&rdquo;</em> is completed and released, is the fact that the  project&rsquo;s &ldquo;micro&rdquo; budget will be <em>one-ten-thousandth</em> of the Columbia  release which it parodies. As Terr seeks completion funding, he is proceeding  with interviews and with background shots in Los Alamos,  home of the atomic bomb and of the fictional website referred to in the film.</p>
