<p class="style4">Newest music craze: <br>
  <em>Do-it-yourself political satire</em> </p>
<table width="362">
  <tr>
    <td width="354"><p class="style5">Santa Fe, NM) A well-known political satirist
        says necessity has forced him to offer his latest parody song in a form
        that will require a little more active participation from listeners.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Jim
        Terr, whose pointed parodies have been broadcast on the ABC, CBS, National
        Public Radio, NBC/Mutual/Westwood One, BBC, Voice of America and Pacifica
        networks and the Larry King, Jim Bohannon, G. Gordon Liddy, Jim Hightower,
        Thom Hartmann, Dr. Demento, and Mountain Stage radio programs, has more
        recently posted his musical satires on his website, <a href="http://www.bluecanyonsatire.com/">www.BlueCanyonSatire.com</a>,
        for free Web listening and free download by broadcasters. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        But, citing
        a lack of funds to produce and post his latest inspiration, Terr has
        simply posted his latest lyrics<em>, “The Girl in the Picture”, </em> a
        parody of the catchy 1966 Del Reeves trucker hit, <em>“The Girl on the
        Billboard,” </em>updated with reference to the female prison guard shown
        in the recent controversial photos of Iraqi prisoner abuse. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Along with
        the lyrics, Terr has posted a sound clip of the original Reeves song,
        so that visitors can hear the original song and just “visualize” the
        new lyrics set to music. “People will have to participate a little more,
        and put the tune and the lyrics together for themselves, but that's probably
        a good thing,” Terr said. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Terr's new lyric is unusual in that it
is less partisan and finger-pointing than most of his song creations. “It kills
        me not to have a clear villain, but in this situation, I've taken a more
        ecumenical approach, leaving aside the issue of having swept this scandal
        under the rug until the photos were revealed,” he says. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        &nbsp;The first line
        of Reeves' original 1966 hit was <em>“Who is the girl
          wearing nothing but a smile and a towel in the picture on the billboard
          in the field near the big old highway?” </em> The first line of Terr's
          parody: <em>“Who is the girl wearing nothing but a smile by the pile
          of Iraqis in the picture that they showed last week on 60 Minutes?” <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>Terr's
          song satires and commentaries and Web campaigns are ordinarily funded
          by private contributions, but funds were simply not available on a
          timely basis to record the new song, Terr said. The BlueCanyonSatire
        website currently has a minor Internet and alternative radio hit with
        a parody of another c/w hit, George Jones' <em>“She Thinks I Still Care.” <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>This and three other current Terr parodies were
all included in the CCCP Comedy Group program broadcast May 6 from the Pacifica
Network flagship station, WBAI-FM in New York City. </p>    </td>
