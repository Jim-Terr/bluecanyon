                <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">During the 
                  period that Kristallnacht took place, all Jewish men over a 
                  certain age were rounded up and taken to concentration camps. 
                  And some curious things happened. For example, my brother, who 
                  had not seen his uncle for many years, ran into his uncle. Another 
                  thing happened at that same concentration camp was that my brother 
                  in law, Herbert, was in that same concentration camp standing 
                  next to his brother Sigi, and at one point or another there 
                  was a get-together. Some commandant had asked for people to 
                  assemble, and he asked them is there anybody who is going to 
                  emigrate during the next few weeks. So Herbert grabbed his brother 
                  by the hand and dragged him those fateful steps forward. It 
                  turns out that Herbert hadn't the foggiest idea where to go 
                  but he figured anything to get out of the concentration camp. 
                  So subsequently they went to Shanghai, which was the only place 
                  that would take refugees. Other countries had their regular 
                  immigration quotas, and they didn't deviate. For example, in 
                  the United States&#133; Anyhow, that single step forward turned 
                  out to be his lifesaver. </font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">My sister 
                  Lizzie was on her way to England when war broke out, and she 
                  found herself in Holland, she was being hidden by the Dutch 
                  underground. At one point or another the Germans ordered all 
                  Dutch Jews and other Jews to come to a certain location. Now 
                  Jews had been required to wear the Star of David, and my sister 
                  Lizzie, when that occurred, took the Star of David she had been 
                  wearing and took it off and tacked it on very loosely. At that 
                  point, it occurred that there were orders to assemble someplace, 
                  and she got herself two tickets: one ticket for the destination 
                  where they were supposed to go, and another for an in-between 
                  station. So when the train stopped at the in-between station, 
                  she tore quickly the Star of David off her sleeve and gave the 
                  agent the ticket that was required, and she was never to be 
                  seen again by the Germans. </font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(A native 
                  of Holland, Dr. VanDenHeuvel gave this address at the dedication 
                  of the Holocaust Memorial in Albuquerque, New Mexico November 
                  8, 1998) </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When I was 
                  a young boy about 10 years old, Monday I was ready to go to 
                  school, my friend Irving came out of his house, he looked weird, 
                  he had a big yellow thing on his coat. I said Irving what is 
                  that? And he said it's a Star of David. I'd never seen a Star 
                  of David, I said what do you mean, a Star of David, what is 
                  it? He explained to me, he said well you know I'm Jewish and 
                  the Nazis are making us wear these things. I didn't know about 
                  the Star of David, I didn't know about Irving being Jewish or 
                  anything else. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Andrew asked 
                  me when he spoke to me on the phone a few days ago, why did 
                  your father do this? Because many of your friends were Jewish, 
                  or because you feel close to the Jewish people? The answer is, 
                  really, neither. Because these were human beings who were about 
                  to be killed, and my dad reacted as a human being to the plight 
                  of another human being, whether Jew, Catholic, immigrant, schizophrenic, 
                  homosexual, Gypsy, on and on. We all know that thousands of 
                  groups over the years, through the history of mankind have been 
                  persecuted and killed. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">You have 
                  to understand that to do something like this meant, if you were 
                  lucky, you'd be arrested and deported to a slave labor camp. 
                  But normally it meant that you and your family would be shot. 
                  I saw many people put up against the wall and shot for this 
                  very thing, for hiding and transporting in the underground, 
                  Jews or other people. So my father took the risk, risked his 
                  own life, my life, my mother's life, and the lives of all seven 
                  children in our family.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">My question 
                  to you this afternoon is, how many of us would risk his life, 
                  her life, and the lives of all the people in your family, for 
                  the sake of another person whom you don't know, have never seen, 
                  and will never see again? Because they only stay in your house 
                  one night. You don't know who they are, and you're not told 
                  who they are. All in order to provide as much protection in 
                  this house. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I heard 
                  a TV program some years ago where a retired photographer, US 
                  Army photographer showed the most horrendous photographs of 
                  the Holocaust. At the end of the program the reporter asked 
                  him what did you take away from all this? What does it all mean? 
                  What are we to learn from this? Because after all if we don't 
                  learn from history we're bound to repeat it. The mans' answer 
                  was, these Nazis who killed the Jews and the other people in 
                  the Holocaust, were not little men from Mars. They were like 
                  you and me. The ability to do lives in the heart of the human 
                  being. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Thomas Merton, 
                  the Catholic scholar, mystic, monk, said &quot;Violence lives 
                  in every person. It is to make The Other different, and to declare 
                  ourselves the norm and defender of human behavior.&quot; The 
                  very thing each one of us does, I'm afraid, many times, each 
                  day. That's how it starts out: put a star on a guy, make him 
                  different. That's how it starts up. That we may never forget 
                  the start and the story I told you today. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With your 
                  permission, I end with a very brief prayer: &quot;Oh Lord, give 
                  eternal rest to the victims of the Holocaust. May Your light 
                  shine on them and on the survivors forever.&quot;</font> </p>
