            Attacks, Praise Stretch Truth at GOP Convention </font></b></font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">03 September 2008 
            by Jim Kuhnhenn, The Associated Press &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080904/ap_on_el_pr/cvn_fact_check;_ylt=AhszAmPCUA4SxEMTrIQhoWSs0NUE">source 
            article</a></font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Many claims at 
            the Republican convention were false. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Alaska Gov. Sarah 
            Palin and her Republican supporters held back little Wednesday as 
            they issued dismissive attacks on Barack Obama and flattering praise 
            on her credentials to be vice president. In some cases, the reproach 
            and the praise stretched the truth. Some examples: </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>PALIN:</b> 
            "I have protected the taxpayers by vetoing wasteful spending ... and 
            championed reform to end the abuses of earmark spending by Congress. 
            I told the Congress 'thanks but no thanks' for that Bridge to Nowhere." 
            </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>THE FACTS</b>: 
            As mayor of Wasilla, Palin hired a lobbyist and traveled to Washington 
            annually to support earmarks for the town totaling $27 million. In 
            her two years as governor, Alaska has requested nearly $750 million 
            in special federal spending, by far the largest per-capita request 
            in the nation. While Palin notes she rejected plans to build a $398 
            million bridge from Ketchikan to an island with 50 residents and an 
            airport, that opposition came only after the plan was ridiculed nationally 
            as a "bridge to nowhere." </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>PALIN</b>: 
            "There is much to like and admire about our opponent. But listening 
            to him speak, it's easy to forget that this is a man who has authored 
            two memoirs but not a single major law or reform - not even in the 
            state senate." </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>THE FACTS</b>: 
            Compared to McCain and his two decades in the Senate, Obama does have 
            a more meager record. But he has worked with Republicans to pass legislation 
            that expanded efforts to intercept illegal shipments of weapons of 
            mass destruction and to help destroy conventional weapons stockpiles. 
            The legislation became law last year. To demean that accomplishment 
            would be to also demean the work of Republican Sen. Richard Lugar 
            of Indiana, a respected foreign policy voice in the Senate. In Illinois, 
            he was the leader on two big, contentious measures in Illinois: studying 
            racial profiling by police and requiring recordings of interrogations 
            in potential death penalty cases. He also successfully co-sponsored 
            major ethics reform legislation. </font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>PALIN:</b> 
            "The Democratic nominee for president supports plans to raise income 
            taxes, raise payroll taxes, raise investment income taxes, raise the 
            death tax, raise business taxes, and increase the tax burden on the 
            American people by hundreds of billions of dollars." </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>THE FACTS:</b> 
            The Tax Policy Center, a think tank run jointly by the Brookings Institution 
            and the Urban Institute, concluded that Obama's plan would increase 
            after-tax income for middle-income taxpayers by about 5 percent by 
            2012, or nearly $2,200 annually. McCain's plan, which cuts taxes across 
            all income levels, would raise after tax-income for middle-income 
            taxpayers by 3 percent, the center concluded. Obama would provide 
            $80 billion in tax breaks, mainly for poor workers and the elderly, 
            including tripling the Earned Income Tax Credit for minimum-wage workers 
            and higher credits for larger families. He also would raise income 
            taxes, capital gains and dividend taxes on the wealthiest. He would 
            raise payroll taxes on taxpayers with incomes above $250,000, and 
            he would raise corporate taxes. Small businesses that make more than 
            $250,000 a year would see taxes rise. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>MCCAIN:</b> 
            "She's been governor of our largest state, in charge of 20 percent 
            of America's energy supply ... She's responsible for 20 percent of 
            the nation's energy supply. I'm entertained by the comparison and 
            I hope we can keep making that comparison that running a political 
            campaign is somehow comparable to being the executive of the largest 
            state in America," he said in an interview with ABC News' Charles 
            Gibson.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>THE FACTS:</b> 
            McCain's phrasing exaggerates both claims. Palin is governor of a 
            state that ranks second nationally in crude oil production, but she's 
            no more "responsible" for that resource than President Bush was when 
            he was governor of Texas, another oil-producing state. In fact, her 
            primary power is the ability to tax oil, which she did in concert 
            with the Alaska Legislature. And where Alaska is the largest state 
            in America, McCain could as easily have called it the 47th largest 
            state - by population. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>MCCAIN:</b> 
            "She's the commander of the Alaska National Guard. ... She has been 
            in charge, and she has had national security as one of her primary 
            responsibilities," he said on ABC. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>THE FACTS</b>: 
            While governors are in charge of their state guard units, that authority 
            ends whenever those units are called to actual military service. When 
            guard units are deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan, for example, they 
            assume those duties under "federal status," which means they report 
            to the Defense Department, not their governors. Alaska's national 
            guard units have a total of about 4,200 personnel, among the smallest 
            of state guard organizations. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>FORMER ARKANSAS 
            GOV. MIKE HUCKABEE:</b> Palin "got more votes running for mayor of 
            Wasilla, Alaska than Joe Biden got running for president of the United 
            States." </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>THE FACTS</b>: 
            A whopper. Palin got 616 votes in the 1996 mayor's election, and got 
            909 in her 1999 re-election race, for a total of 1,525. Biden dropped 
            out of the race after the Iowa caucuses, but he still got 76,165 votes 
            in 23 states and the District of Columbia where he was on the ballot 
            during the 2008 presidential primaries.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>FORMER MASSACHUSETTS 
            GOV. MITT ROMNEY:</b> "We need change, all right - change from a liberal 
            Washington to a conservative Washington! We have a prescription for 
            every American who wants change in Washington - throw out the big-government 
            liberals, and elect John McCain and Sarah Palin." </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>THE FACTS</b>: 
            A Back-to-the-Future moment. George W. Bush, a conservative Republican, 
            has been president for nearly eight years. And until last year, Republicans 
            controlled Congress. Only since January 2007 have Democrats have been 
            in charge of the House and Senate. </font></p>
