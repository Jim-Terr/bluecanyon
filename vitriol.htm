        <p><font size="5"><strong>Exploiting the Atrocity</strong></font><br>
            Commentary by Paul Krugman / <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/top/opinion/editorialsandoped/oped/columnists/paulkrugman/">The New
            York Times</a><br>
            <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">September 12,
            2003</font><br>
            <br>
            In my first column after 9/11, I mentioned something everyone with 
            contacts on Capitol Hill already knew: that just days after the 
            event, the exploitation of the atrocity for partisan political gain 
            had already begun.<br>
            <br>
            In response, I received a torrent of outraged mail. At a time when 
            the nation was shocked and terrified, the thought that our leaders 
            might be that cynical was too much to bear. ``How can I say that to 
            my young son?'' asked one furious e-mailer.<br>
            <br>
            I wonder what that correspondent thinks now. Is the public - and the
             news media - finally prepared to cry foul when cynicism comes wrapped
            in the flag? America's political future may rest on the answer.<br>
            <br>
            The press has become a lot less shy about pointing out the
            administration's exploitation of 9/11, partly because that 
            exploitation has become so crushingly obvious. As The Washington Post
            pointed out yesterday, in the past six weeks President Bush has 
            invoked 9/11 not just to defend Iraq policy and argue for oil drilling
            in the Arctic, but in response to questions about tax cuts, unemployment,
            budget deficits and even campaign finance. Meanwhile,
             the crudity of the administration's recent propaganda efforts, from
             dressing the president up in a flight suit to orchestrating the 
            ludicrously glamorized TV movie about Mr. Bush on 9/11, have set even
            supporters' teeth on edge.<br>
            <br>
            And some stunts no longer seem feasible. Maybe it was the pressure of
            other commitments that kept Mr. Bush from visiting New York 
            yesterday; but one suspects that his aides no longer think of the Big
            Apple as a politically safe place to visit.<br>
            <br>
            Yet it's almost certainly wrong to think that the political 
            exploitation of 9/11 and, more broadly, the administration's campaign
            to label critics as unpatriotic are past their peak. It may be harder
            for the administration to wrap itself in the flag, but it has more 
            incentive to do so now than ever before. Where once the administration
            was motivated by greed, now it's driven by fear.<br>
            <br>
            In the first months after 9/11, the administration's ruthless 
            exploitation of the atrocity was a choice, not a necessity. The 
            natural instinct of the nation to rally around its leader in times of
            crisis had pushed Mr. Bush into the polling stratosphere, and his 
            re-election seemed secure. He could have governed as the uniter he 
            claimed to be, and would probably still be wildly popular.<br>
            <br>
            But Mr. Bush's advisers were greedy; they saw 9/11 as an opportunity
            to get everything they wanted, from another round of tax cuts, to a 
            major weakening of the Clean Air Act, to an invasion of Iraq. And so
             they wrapped as much as they could in the flag.<br>
            <br>
            Now it has all gone wrong. The deficit is about to go above half a 
            trillion dollars, the economy is still losing jobs, the triumph in 
            Iraq has turned to dust and ashes, and Mr. Bush's poll numbers are at
            or below their pre-9/11 levels.<br>
            <br>
            Nor can the members of this administration simply lose like 
            gentlemen. For one thing, that's not how they operate. Furthermore, 
            everything suggests that there are major scandals - involving energy
             policy, environmental policy, Iraq contracts and cooked intelligence
            - that would burst into the light of day if the current management 
            lost its grip on power. So these people must win, at any cost.<br>
            <br>
            The result, clearly, will be an ugly, bitter campaign - probably the
             nastiest of modern American history. Four months ago it seemed that
             the 2004 campaign would be all slow-mo films of Mr. Bush in his 
            flight suit. But at this point, it's likely to be pictures of Howard
             Dean or Wesley Clark that morph into Saddam Hussein. And Donald 
            Rumsfeld has already rolled out the stab-in-the-back argument: if you
            criticize the administration, you're lending aid and comfort to the <br>
            enemy.<br>
            <br>
            This political ugliness will take its toll on policy, too. The 
            administration's infallibility complex - its inability to admit ever
             making a mistake - will get even worse. And I disagree with those who
            think the administration can claim infallibility even while 
            practicing policy flexibility: on major issues, such as taxes or 
            Iraq, any sensible policy would too obviously be an implicit 
            admission that previous policies had failed.<br>
            <br>
            In other words, if you thought the last two years were bad, just 
            wait: it's about to get worse. A lot worse.<br>

            </font></p>
          <p><font size="3">BUZZFLASH: Many of our readers don't realize that
              you are an economics professor at Princeton. How did you come to
              write a column for The New York Times op-ed page?</font></p>
          <p><font size="3">KRUGMAN: Well, they just called me out of the blue.
              Actually it was
            Tom Friedman who acted as intermediary, because I'd met him. But
            it 
            was just out of the blue. It was 1999, and at the time, it seemed
              like our problem was: &quot;How do we deal with prosperity and
              all the 
            interesting things that were happening in the business world?&quot; They
            thought that they needed somebody to write about that, and somehow
            had learned that in addition to regular professor-type stuff, I'd
            actually been writing journalistic pieces for Fortune and for Slate,
            and they asked me to come on. It seemed like it might be interesting and
            fun, and of course we figured that the U.S. policy would be  sensible
            and reasonable, and I'd be writing mostly about disasters
            elsewhere of the new economy. And what do you know? It turned out
            to 
          be something quite different from anything we imagined.</font></p>
          <p><font size="3">BUZZFLASH: Your focus is often on international trade
            and international monetary systems.</font></p>
          <p><font size="3">KRUGMAN: Yes, the professional work is basically about that.</font></p>
          <p><font size="3">BUZZFLASH: You're not a full-time journalist. Do
              you think that gives
            you a bit of distance from both the media and from politics when
            you 
          write your columns?</font></p>
          <p><font size="3">KRUGMAN: What it means is that I don't have any of
              the usual journalistic or the journalists' incentives. I'm not
              part of the 
            club. I'm not socially part of that world. I don't go to Washington
              cocktail parties, so I don't get sucked into whatever kind of 
            group-think there may be, for better or for worse. I don't 
            necessarily hear all the latest rumors, but I also don't fold in
            with 
          the latest view on how you're supposed to think about things.</font></p>
          <p><font size="3">It also means that I'm moonlighting. This is not
              my career, or I didn't think it is, anyway. And if it means that
              if I'm frozen out, 
            if the Times finally decides I'm too hot to handle and fires me or
              whatever, that's no great loss. So I'm a lot more independent than
          your ordinary average journalist would be.</font></p>
          <p><font size="3">BUZZFLASH: You make the case that a revolutionary,
              right wing movement has set out to transform the United States,
              and they're 
            succeeding. So much of the print media and so many television 
            broadcast journalists have become more like stenographers for the
              official government spin than probing journalists. What's your
              take 
          on that?</font></p>
          <p><font size="3">KRUGMAN: Well, a couple of things. The first is that
              a good part of
            the media are essentially part of the machine. If you work for any
              Murdoch publication or network, or if you work for the Rev. Moon's
              empire, you're really not a journalist in the way that we used
              to 
            think. You're basically just part of a propaganda machine. And that's
          a pretty large segment of the media.</font></p>
          <p><font size="3">As for the rest, certainly being critical at the
              level I've been critical -&#8211; basically saying that these guys
              are lying, even if it's
            staring you in the face &#8211;- is a very unpleasant experience.
            You get a 
            lot of heat from people who should be on your side, because they
             accuse you of being shrill, which is everybody's favorite word for
            me. And you become a personal target. It can be quite frightening.
            I've seen cases where a journalist starts to say something less than
            reverential about Bush, and then catches himself or herself, and
            says something like, &quot;Oh, I better not say that, I'll get 'mailed.'&quot; And
            what they mean by &quot;mail&quot; is hate mail, and it also means
            that 
            somebody is going to try to see if there's anything in your personal
            history that can be used to smear you.</font></p>
          <p><font size="3">It's like shock therapy, aversion therapy. If you
              touch these things, you yourself are going to get an unpleasant,
              painful electric shock. 
          And most people in the media just back off as a result.</font></p>
          <p><font size="3">BUZZFLASH: Bottom line: It's just easier not to be critical.</font></p>
          <p><font size="3">KRUGMAN: Your personal life, your professional life,
              is much easier if you oscillate between reverential pieces about
              the commander in 
            chief and cynical pieces which equate minor foibles on one side with
          grotesque lies or deceptions on the other.</font></p>
          <p><font size="3">BUZZFLASH: Economic decisions are certainly politicized,
              but you do
            have numbers -&#8211; you have the advantage of showing what works,
            what 
            doesn't, which numbers add up, and which don't. It seems like so
            much 
            of the criticism you get is sort of dismissive, but no one challenges
            you on the substance of the arguments you're making.</font></p>
          <p><font size="3">KRUGMAN: Oh, I get challenged all the time on the
              substance, but usually by people who have no clue, or who are just
              looking for 
            anything. So if I say the number is 2.15 and it's actually 2.143,
              someone will come after me, saying: &quot;Lie, lie &#8211; it's inaccurate!&quot; So
              that's what's going on. But the amazing thing about this is that
              we're not talking about close calls here. When you talk about [Bush]
              administration policy, it's not a case of, well, &quot;OK, maybe
            I 
            disagree with your model, but according to your model, this policy
              will do what you say it will.&quot; These guys are insisting all
            the time 
            that two minus one equals four. There isn't any reasonable argument
          in their favor, but there's a lot of power in their favor.</font></p>
          <p><font size="3">BUZZFLASH: There's a wonderful chapter in the book
              of your collection of columns on that theme. Let's focus on something
              specific -&#8211; the unprecedented deficit. Last week, I think
              it was projected at nearly $500 billion, staggering even beyond
              Bush Senior's records in the
              early '90s. How is it that this has not become more of an issue,
            and 
            why don't more Americans see this as gross mismanagement of the 
            economy?</font></p>
          <p><font size="3">KRUGMAN: Well, for the general public, it's very
              abstract. It's very
            hard to understand. Understandably, there are a very small number
            of 
            people who sit down and do the accounting, and say, &quot;Gee, how
            are we 
            going to pay for Social Security in the next decade, given this?&quot;            It's
            not quantum mechanics; it's not hard stuff, but it does take some
            attention. The truth is, when I started doing this column, I 
            wasn't a U.S. budget expert at all, and I had to put in a lot of
            work 
            learning how to read those numbers. And you don't expect the guy
            in <br>
          the street to understand that.</font></p>
          <p><font size="3">As for the media, I guess the point is that not very
              many people understand this stuff. And those who do &#8211;- the idea of saying, &quot;My
              god, these guys are looting the country&quot; -&#8211; that's uncool.
            It's not 
            what you want to do. Right now there's a column in the latest 
            Newsweek entitled, &quot;The Brainteaser of Deficit Math,&quot; which
            basically 
            confirms everything I've been saying all along, that this is wildly
            irresponsible and it's actually unsustainable. But the tone is kind
            of distant and cool. I don't know whether he actually doesn't feel
          any outrage, or just feels he shouldn't do that.</font></p>
          <p><font size="3">BUZZFLASH: Two points to add to that is during the
              last press conference that Bush held before he went off to Crawford,
              Texas,
              he 
            was asked once or twice about the deficit by a couple of reporters.
              And he deflected the questions and kept talking about jobs. You
              could
            tell there was a clear strategy to not talk about the deficit. 
            Instead, Bush talked about something tangible to make it appear to
          the American public that Bush was concerned about creating jobs.</font></p>
          <p><font size="3">Do you think part of the reason that people don't
              hold the Bush administration more accountable is that they basically
              just give
              it 
            the benefit of doubt? As if to say, &quot;Surely someone in power
            has to 
            know what they're doing; there has to be logic to the madness and
          order in the chaos.&quot;</font></p>
          <p><font size="3">KRUGMAN: I waver on that. Sometimes I think that's
              what people think. Certainly, I think that's the case with a lot
              of the media. The 
            concept that the president of the United States is flat-out lying
              about the sustainability of his own economic policy -&#8211; that's
            too 
            high a hill for them to climb. And I guess the general public tends
          to give him the benefit of the doubt.</font></p>
          <p><font size="3">But there's a definite tilt in the way these things
              are covered and
            perceived. I think the average voter in California is feeling 
            outraged about the state's $38 billion deficit, and then you stop
            and 
            think for a second. You say, wait a second &#8211;- first of all,
            it's not 
            $38 billion. It turns out that was a two-year number, and this year
            they've closed the books. And it's only $8 billion for next year. And,
            anyway, that number should be as abstract and remote from the ordinary
            residents of California as the national budget deficit is
            from the ordinary American.</font></p>
          <p><font size="3">But there's a machine that keeps on beating it out, saying Davis
            is <br>
            bad; Davis is irresponsible; the deficit &#8211;- he lied to us.
            And the <br>
            press picks it up, and, in turn, it makes its way to the public.
            So <br>
            you have a situation in which mainstream publications continue to <br>
            report and hammer on Davis' $38 billion deficit, which isn't even <br>
            remotely true, while Bush, for the most part, gets a free pass on
            the <br>
            $500 billion deficit which is absolutely real.</font></p>
          <p><font size="3">BUZZFLASH: In your book, you give special attention
              to the origins of
            the California energy crisis. Who would you say is to blame for that?</font></p>
          <p><font size="3">KRUGMAN: What actually happened in California was
              that the system was
            a little short on capacity &#8211;- not actually less capacity than
            demand, 
            but the usual margin wasn't there because of a drought and a couple
            of other things. That created a situation in which energy companies
            could game the system by strategically taking a plant offline or
             scheduling a power transmission in such a way that it could be 
            guaranteed to create congestion on the transmission grid, and a whole
            bunch of other strategies. Basically by pulling power off the market,
            they could drive prices up.</font></p>
          <p><font size="3">So what you had was a basically normal, slightly
              tight power situation that was transformed into a wild chaos of
              brownouts, 
            blackouts, and prices up to 50 times what's normal due to companies
            gaming the system. It wasn't some vast conspiracy. It was mostly
             companies seeing what they could do individually. And it was created
            by a badly conceived deregulation scheme that set the system up for
            this to happen. So that's the story, and if you have to say who's
            to 
            blame, well, companies were out there maximizing profits quite 
            ruthlessly, but that's to be expected. You want to blame Pete Wilson
            for setting up the system where that could happen, and you want to
            blame the energy regulators, which basically means the feds, for
          refusing to do anything about it.</font></p>
          <p><font size="3">BUZZFLASH: You had a wonderful column on Arnold Schwarzenegger,&quot;
            Conan the Deceiver,&quot; and what little details he's revealed
              of his 
            economic plan. I think it must be maddening for you to actually 
            understand what the real-life consequences are of the empty rhetoric
            that politicians make.</font></p>
          <p><font size="3">KRUGMAN: Well, I've given up a lot to do this column.
              My habitat before was not just academics, but I was part of the
              sort of 
            high-level, very genteel policy circuit -&#8211; you know, finance
            ministers, economists and big bankers, sitting around tables with
            glasses of mineral water, and having high-minded discussions about
            global policy. I'm very much part of that, or I was very much part
            of 
            that comfortable world where the working assumptions &#8211;- the
            pretense, 
            if you like -&#8211; is that we're all men of good will, and it's
            all 
            intelligent and that the issues are deep. And if there are divisions,
          it's because there are really two sides.</font></p>
          <p><font size="3">And then here I am in the middle of this, trying
              desperately to get a
            few more people to notice that we have wildly dishonest, 
            irresponsible people making policy in the world's greatest nation.
              And currents of abuse are coming in the mail and over the e-mails,
              as 
            we saw. There are many mornings when I wake up and say, &quot;Why
              am I 
          doing this? But you got to do it.&quot;</font></p>
          <p><font size="3">BUZZFLASH: Grover Norquist, head of Americans for
              Tax Reform and a
board member of the National Rifle Association and GOP advisor, made
              a comment that he wants to shrink the size of the federal government
              so small that he could drown it in a bathtub. When you look at
              the 
            Bush economic policy, are we dealing with an ideology to destroy
               social programs and the federal government? Or is it mismanagement?
            Or both?</font></p>
          <p><font size="3">KRUGMAN: I think you have to think of this as there's
              more than one
            player in this thing. If you ask Norquist or the Heritage Foundation
              about where the economic and social policy intelligentsia really
              stands, their aim is to roll us back to Herbert Hoover or before.
              Norquist actually thinks that we've got to get back to before the
              progressive movement &#8211;- before the McKinley era, which actually
            is 
            one of Karl Rove's guiding lights as well. So there's definitely
            an important faction in the Bush administration and in the Republican
            Party that really wants to unravel all of this stuff and basically
            wants us to go back to a situation where, if you are unlucky, and
            you 
            don't have enough to eat, or you can't afford medical care, well,
            that's just showing that you weren't sufficiently provident. And
             then, for these people, there would be no social safety net <br>
          whatsoever.</font></p>
          <p><font size="3">Other people in the party, and other people in the
              coalition, have
            deluded themselves into thinking that somehow this is all going to
              be 
            painless, and we're going to grow our way out of the deficit. Other
              people really don't care about any of that and are viewing their
              alliance with these people as a way to achieve their social goals
            -&#8211;            basically roll back the revolution in social
            mores over the past few
          decades.</font></p>
          <p><font size="3">So there is a coalition, but there's no question
              that if you ask what
            do the core ideologues want, the answer is they want to roll it all
              back. If you looked at what the Heritage Foundation says, they
              use 
            the terms &quot;New Deal&quot; and &quot;Great Society&quot; as essentially
            curse words. 
            Everything Franklin Roosevelt or Lyndon Johnson did to provide a
             little bit of a cushion for Americans having bad luck is a bad thing,
          from their point of view.</font></p>
          <p><font size="3">BUZZFLASH: As a professor, if you were giving a lecture
              and you had
            to define the economic policy of the Bush administration, could you
            get your arms around it? How would you define it?</font></p>
          <p><font size="3">KRUGMAN: There is no economic policy. That's really
              important to say.
            The general modus operandi of the Bushies is that they don't make
              policies to deal with problems. They use problems to justify things
              they wanted to do anyway. So there is no policy to deal with the
            lack 
            of jobs. There really isn't even a policy to deal with terrorism.
              It's all about how can we spin what's happening out there to do
              what 
          we want to do.</font></p>
          <p><font size="3">Now if you ask what do the people who keep pushing
              for one tax cut
            after another want to accomplish, the answer is they are basically
              aiming to create a fiscal crisis which will provide the environment
          in which they can basically eliminate the welfare state.</font></p>
          <p><font size="3">BUZZFLASH: Talking about perception, why is it, even
              after the staggering deficits, and three million jobs lost, when
              you look at 
            the polls, ordinary people perceive Republicans as better at managing
            the economy and the federal budget than Democrats. Even though we're
            just starting to understand just how good the Clinton-Gore economic
            policies were, the false perception still exists the Republicans
            can 
          handle the economy better.</font></p>
          <p><font size="3">KRUGMAN: Again, I think it comes back to press coverage.
              Just this weekend, I was looking at something: There's an enormous
              scandal 
            right now involving Boeing and a federal contract, which appears
            to 
            have been overpaid by $4 billion. The Pentagon official who was 
            responsible for the contract has now left and has become a top 
            executive at Boeing. And it's been barely covered in the press &#8211;-
            a 
            couple of stories on inside pages. You compare that with the White
            House travel office in 1993. There were accusations, later found
            to 
            be false, that the Clintons had intervened improperly to dismiss
            a couple of employees in the White House travel office.</font></p>
          <p><font size="3">That was the subject, in the course of one month,
              of three front-page
            stories in the Washington Post. So if people don't understand how
              badly things are being managed now, and have an unduly negative
              sense
            of how things were managed in the Clinton years, well, there in a
          nutshell is your explanation.</font></p>
          <p><font size="3">BUZZFLASH: If you had to make a projection, do you
              think Clinton's presidency &#8211;- specifically his economic policy
              and what he did in 
            terms of generating jobs and creating surpluses &#8211;- will survive
            as 
            his legacy, versus what happened afterwards with the Bush 
          administration?</font></p>
          <p><font size="3">KRUGMAN: Well, I think Clinton's successes will be
              overshadowed by
            the scale of the disaster that followed. Not that Clinton will be
            blamed. I think historians will say, &quot;Gee, there was a sensible,
            basically well-intentioned government that dealt successfully with
            a 
          bunch of crazies.&quot;</font></p>
          <p><font size="3">A lot of good things happened in the 1920s, although
              there were a
            couple of really bad presidents. But all of that now, in historical
          memory, is colored by the realization of what followed afterwards.</font></p>
          <p><font size="3">I think that with the looming disasters of the budget
              on foreign policy &#8211;- and the things that really scare me,
              which I know we're not
            going to get into but let's just mention the erosion of civil 
            liberties at home -&#8211; I think that, in retrospect, this will
            be seen 
            in terms of how did the country head over this cliff. I hope I'm
            wrong. If there's regime change in 2004, and the new man actually
            manages to steer us away from the disasters I see in front of us,
            then we'll probably be talking a lot about the long boom that was
            begun during the Clinton years, and how it was resilient, even to
            an 
          episode of incredibly bad management.</font></p>
          <p><font size="3">But I don't think that's the way it's going to play
              out, to be
            honest. Whatever happens in the election, I think that we've done
              an 
          extraordinary amount of damage in the last three years.</font></p>
          <p><font size="3">BUZZFLASH: Looking just at the economic impact of
              Iraq, how much of a strain will that continue to be?</font></p>
          <p><font size="3">KRUGMAN: Well, there are levels and levels. I think
              Iraq is going to
            cost us $100 billion a year for the indefinite future. Now at one
              level, you can say, well, that's only about 20 percent of our budget
              deficit, and it's only about 5 percent of the federal budget. But
            on 
            the other hand, it's being added onto a very nasty situation. It's
            a 
            little unpredictable. I don't know how much collateral damage Iraq
            is 
            going to inflict. At the rate we're going, it's clear that unless
              something happens soon, we're going to have a much bigger Army.
              It
            may seem like we have enough troops, but I've been talking to people,
            including officers, who are just crying about what they see as the
          degradation of the Army's quality because of all of this.</font></p>
          <p><font size="3">Right now, I'm trying to understand what a petroleum
              industry expert
            is telling me, when he says that some of the market futures suggest
              that the market is pricing in about a one- in-three chance that
              unrest in Iraq spreads to Saudi Arabia. And if that happens, of
          course, then we're talking about a mammoth disaster.</font></p>
          <p><font size="3">BUZZFLASH: I've got to say I don't know how you sleep at night.</font></p>
          <p><font size="3">KRUGMAN: I have a little trouble, to be honest. It's
              this funny thing: I lived this very comfortable life in a very
              placid college 
            town, with nice people all around. And life is good. But some of
            us 
            -&#8211; not just me, but a fair number of people, including my friends
            -- 
            we've looked at the news, and we sort of extrapolate the lines 
          forward. And there's this feeling of creeping dread.</font></p>
          <p><font size="3">BUZZFLASH: James Carville, I think, called you courageous.
              Do you
            just call it like you see it? Do you just look at the numbers and
          tell people what the numbers tell you?</font></p>

        <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KRUGMAN: I could
            have made the decision to either not do this column or to do it and
            to say, OK, my expertise is economics, and I'm going 
            to write this in a very cool fashion. And I'm going to write columns
            praising something, anything about the Bushies, and make snide 
            attacks on the Democrats, just to keep an even-handed feel to it,
            so 
            that people won't get mad at me. And I decided not to do that. For
            whatever the reason was -&#8211; pig- headedness or whatever &#8211;-
            I certainly 
          stuck my neck out quite a lot.</font></p>
