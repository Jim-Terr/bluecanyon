		“I never wanted this job anyway. Why would I, considered by most to be a 
		very high-IQ genius, willingly subject myself to four (let alone 8!) 
		years of insults by mean people, mistreatment by bad people, attacks on 
		myself and my character and my family? Do you think I don't make more 
		money at my regular job, building beautiful buildings, resorts, products 
		and events? <br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This whole thing started when I was insulted by Obama at 
		that White House Press Dinner in 2011. What did I do to deserve such 
		ridicule? Only a president (like Obama) is entitled to such ridicule, 
		it's part of the job. Did I ever question Obama's paternity or anything 
		like that? The answer is no. <br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will admit that my anger swelled up in me at that time, 
		and I think the idea of running for president germinated at that moment. 
		It took years of stewing about it, and encouragement from many bright 
		people to help me achieve…&nbsp; 
		<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But I've had my 
		fun now, and four years was enough. They can find someone else to beat 
		up on. I did not come on to this earth to be beaten about the head and 
		shoulders every day by low-IQ people who have no respect for the office 
		of the president, no more than for capitalism or patriotism.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
