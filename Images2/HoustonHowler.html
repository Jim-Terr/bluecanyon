			  YouTube channel</a> boasts almost three million views, and many of 
			  his recent posts are music videos about the shortcomings of Donald 
			  Trump - some of them quite dire and apocalyptic. For instance, 
			  "<a href="https://youtu.be/THQydJsXBvM">Reichstag Fire</a>" flat-out predicts that Trump will use some 
			  pretense for a national emergency to declare martial law and 
			  cancel the upcoming elections - just as Hitler did!</span></p>

			  <span style="font-style: normal">Still, the New Mexico satirist

			  <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-jim-terrs-antitrump-initiatives" moz-do-not-send="true">
			  fundraiser</a>, "No, I don't hate Trump. I consider him, like 
			  Hitler and Stalin and other megalomaniacs, to be a damaged 
			  personality who has unfortunately gotten into a position of power 
			  where he can do a lot of damage, as we can see every day... I 
			  think he's still traumatized by his recent brush with 
			  imprisonment, and I think that's making him even more vicious than 
			  he already was."</span></p>

			  <p class="auto-style35" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
			  <span style="font-style: normal">In numerous songs and essays, 
			  Terr has no hesitation in comparing Trump to the German dictator, 
			  in terms of his desire for full control of the country. "I think 
			  it's obvious that's his intention, and that he's put together a 
			  like-minded team who's very supportive of that, and the best use 
			  of my talents is to try to put a wedge between him and his 
			  supporters by creating satire that will reduce the enchantment he 
			  casts over his cult."</span></p>
			  <p class="auto-style35" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
			  <span style="font-style: normal">As a nationally-broadcast 
			  songwriter, jingle producer, and satirist, Terr has gained many
			  <a href="https://www.bluecanyonproductions.com/songwriter.html" moz-do-not-send="true">
			  kudos</a>, but he regrets that he has yet to crack the "viral" 
			  video world of TikTok, X, and Instagram -- despite having as many 
			  as several hundred thousand views on some of his videos. "I think 
			  I need to hire a young consultant who knows that world better than 
			  I do," he says. </span></p>
			  <p class="auto-style35" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
			  <span style="font-style: normal">In addition to getting random 
			  donations for his work on occasional GoFundMe projects, he also 
			  has a very small base of
			  <a href="http://www.patreon.com/JimTerr" moz-do-not-send="true">
			  Patreon</a> patrons who "help me pay the bills," he says. His 
			  <a href="https://gofund.me/2f5b83e3">current project</a> includes sending "wake-up" postcards to the GOP 
			  congresspeople who support Trump, something he has done before.
			  </span></p>
			  <p class="auto-style35" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
			  <span style="font-style: normal">For a couple of award-winning 
			  documentaries he has produced, he has interviewed New Mexico 
			  Holocaust survivors and World War Two veterans, and for other 
			  videos he has interviewed prominent Trump critic (and 
			  ex-staff-member)
			  <a href="https://www.bluecanyonproductions.com/trumpexperts.html" moz-do-not-send="true">
			  Anthony Scaramucci</a>, as well as humorist Dave Barry, NPR's 
			  Scott Simon, James Fallows, Tony Hillerman, Arianna Huffington, 
			  Charles Osgood, Valerie Plame, Mark Rudd, Ali MacGraw, Thom 
			  Hartmann and others, for other videos. <br><br>"But I'd like to interview 
			  Donald Trump if I ever had a chance," he says. "Not to give him 
			  more of a platform, but to try to draw out some interesting 
			  insights into this unusual character -- and perhaps even have a 
			  good influence on him."</span></p>

				Born in Houston in 1942, Andy Burns attained heights of 
				visibility some artists only dream of. Yet today he maintains a 
				low profile in an unpublicized location, his brilliant works the 
				only evidence of a once-booming career. <br><br>Once called "a 
				folksinger on paper," his portraits commemorate everyday 
				laborers, workers, and hustlers. Burns himself has spent more 
				time as a laborer than as a painter -- by choice. <br><br>He was 
				never enchanted by the world of "art with a capital 'A'," though 
				his work has been exhibited at the Museum of Fine Arts and the 
				Fred Kline Gallery in Santa Fe, in Salida, Colorado, The 
				Contemporary Arts Museum in Houston, The Galveston Arts Center, 
				and featured in a four-page cover story in <em>Texas Monthly</em>.
				<br><br>His large (6-foot by 46") oil crayon painting of two 
				Santa Fe bicycle racers was recently discovered in Las Vegas, 
				New Mexico, "the original Las Vegas," an active art and 
				movie-and-TV-filming location. <br><br>Burns said he sometimes 
				toys with returning to painting, but for now is simply enjoying 
				life and retirement.
