          <p align="left"><span class="style8">SYNOPSIS</span> (subject to change...) (c) 2010 Jim Terr </p>
          <p align="left">It&rsquo;s  a strange and alien world. &hellip; Well, it&rsquo;s New    Mexico, which IS a strange and alien world. At least  it USED to be New Mexico,  before the&hellip;well, the Events We Do Not Speak Of occurred &ndash; was it 10 years ago?  20 years ago? We really don&rsquo;t want to remember.</p>
          <p align="left">But  one island of tranquility and relative peace and prosperity remains in this  bleak landscape, and the HummerVees are determined to reach it, to destroy it,  to exploit it for that precious resource which only it has &ndash; in vast  quantities. </p>
          <p align="left">Yes,  we&rsquo;re talking about actual, refined gasoline. Not crude oil, but the real  stuff, tens of thousands of gallons, in tanks that just happened to be located  on what is now a virtual island before &hellip; those Events We Do Not Speak  Of.</p>
          <p align="left">The  Island is ruled &ndash; well, dominated by&hellip;  let&rsquo;s  say the benign yet commanding presence of former c/w legend &ldquo;BuDDy&rdquo; (see <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhR5Hatwax0" class="style6">The Passion of BuDDy</a>&nbsp; <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhR5Hatwax0">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhR5Hatwax0</a> ) is everywhere, and his vast resources from a successful career have helped  create a relatively happy community protected more by natural defenses than by a  fierce militia &ndash; for this would not be in accord with the somewhat jovial nature  of His BuDDyness.</p>
          <p align="left">But the HummerVees will not be deterred by  natural defenses, nor by public opinion nor rules of society &ndash; for those have pretty  much faded into irrelevance. In this stark new world, all that matters is force  &ndash; and petrol. And the HummerVees are determined to attain this grand prize &ndash;  and the grandest artifact of a once-grand civilization, the <strong>Aquacar</strong>. </p>
          <p align="left">Yes, more than just an automobile, more than  just an oddity, this strange mechanical duckling embodies the secrets and the level  of technology which today, if deconstructed and reverse-engineered, could give  the HummerVees the upper hand they need to conquer and dominate this new world.</p>
          <p align="left">And it is not just the Aquacar, but scores of  other <strong>CLASSIC CARS</strong> collected by  BuDDy during his heyday, which are also stored on The Island, monuments to the  glory days of a lost civilization. A constant source of pride and inspiration,  these meticulously maintained automobiles are a light which could potentially  inspire and re-civilize the whole world &ndash; if they are not destroyed first! </p>
          <p align="left">In these Detroit  beauties lies a further secret to energy independence and sustainability&nbsp; -- and consequently world peace! &ndash; being  teased out by a handsome young tinkerer who has known nothing but The Island for  his entire young life.</p>
          <p align="left">A brave and beautiful young woman wedded to the  almost-lost profession of &ldquo;journalism&rdquo; ventures onto The Island to discover, to  understand and perhaps share with the world the secret to a successful,  harmonious society which has sustained The Island&rsquo;s community even as the  outside world has deteriorated. Despite a world of cultural differences, she  forms a strange bond with the handsome young tinkerer, which pits them against  both The Island community (BuDDy in particular!) &ndash; and the hostile outside  world from which she came.</p>
          <p align="left">Will they, together, save the whole shebang?  Stay tuned&hellip;</p>
