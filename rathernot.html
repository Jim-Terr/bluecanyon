  <p class="MsoNormal">CBS &quot;Evening News&quot; anchor and American icon <b>Dan Rather</b> 
  has a problem. We're stepping forward to help, and we'd like to ask you to do 
  the same.&nbsp;</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Although he makes $7 million a year, Rather is evidently 
  insecure about his role as an independent journalist. As a guest on &quot;Late 
  Night With David Letterman&quot; September 17, 2002, Rather stated: &quot;George Bush is 
  the President. He makes the decisions, and, you know, [I'm] just one American, 
  wherever he wants me to line up, just tell me where. And he’ll make the 
  call.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Okay, perhaps an understandable bit of sentimental 
  patriotism one week after the disastrous events of September 11, but then, a 
  full eight months later:</p>

          <p><span style="font-size: 11.0pt">Dan Rather, the star news anchor 
          for the US television network CBS, said last night that &quot;patriotism 
          run amok&quot; was in danger of trampling the freedom of American 
          journalists to ask tough questions. And he admitted that he had shrunk 
          from taking on the Bush administration over the war on terrorism.
          </span></p>
          <p><font face="Arial"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt">In the weeks 
          after September 11 Rather wore a Stars and Stripes pin in his lapel 
          during his evening news show in an apparent display of total 
          solidarity with the American cause. However, in an interview with 
          BBC's Newsnight, he graphically described the pressures to conform 
          that built up after the attacks on the World Trade Centre and the 
          Pentagon.</span></font><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Book Antiqua">

          <p><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Arial">&quot;It is an 
          obscene comparison - you know I am not sure I like it - but you know 
          there was a time in South Africa that people would put flaming tyres 
          around people's necks if they dissented. And in some ways the fear is 
          that you will be necklaced here, you will have a flaming tyre of lack 
          of patriotism put around your neck,&quot; he said. &quot;Now it is that fear 
          that keeps journalists from asking the toughest of the tough 
          questions.&quot;</span></p>

  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="4" color="#008080">Perhaps</font> journalists 
    who make tiny fraction of Rather's salary might be forgiven for shrinking 
    from the tough, sometimes obvious questions, and asking instead the fawning 
    question of their highly-placed sources, in order to protect their access 
    to &quot;off-the-record&quot; information and the occasional exclusive interview, 
    but shouldn't Rather feel secure in his position as an independent journalist, 
    at $7 million a year?&nbsp;</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Clearly he doesn't, and that's why we're requesting that 
    in order to restore Rather's self-confidence and independence, and make him 
    once again an inspiration for younger and less well-paid journalists, that 
    you <u>send Rather a check!</u> Send to: </p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="border: medium none; padding: 0in">A 
                most startling demonstration of how out-of-touch our leaders are, 
                how accustomed they've become to being asked powder-puff questions 
                by journalists, occurred on Election Day of 2000, when President 
                Bill Clinton telephoned Amy Goodman, host of the <i>Democracy 
                Now!</i> radio program, for a two-minute interview that turned 
                into a 30-minute wrangle. &nbsp;</p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="border: medium none; padding: 0in">
          Clinton's defensiveness at being asked some <i>tough, direct 
          questions— <u>for a change</u></i>—was most revealing. Judge for 
          yourself whether Amy did anything more than a journalist <i>should</i> 
          do, whether she was impolite and aggressive, as Clinton repeatedly 
          accused her of being, by listening to this remarkable exchange at
          <a href="http://www.webactive.com/pacifica/demnow/dn20001108.html">
          http://www.webactive.com</a>. For her trouble, Amy was subsequently 
          threatened by a White House official with total loss of access!&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="border: medium none; padding: 0in">
          Incidentally, isn't it interesting that the supposedly far-left <i>
          Democracy Now!</i> is one of the few programs anywhere on radio 
          (right, left or in between) which consistently invites representatives 
          of all sides of an issue—including industry and administration 
          officials—to participate in debates in order to produce a full, 
          balanced picture on any given issue?</p>
