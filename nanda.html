            <p>The INDIGO is a highly sophisticated energetic biofeedback device
              that is based on quantum physics. It allows the biofeedback
              practitioner to help you see yourself holistically via biofeedback
              and a computer program which detects close to 10,000 energetic
              frequencies, which then show up on a computer screen as graphs
              based on the values which indicate to the practitioner which areas
              are of the most concern. </p>
            <p>The <span class="style6">INDIGO</span> program interacts with
              your body and with your brain – the most sophisticated computer
              which exists – to detect frequencies associated with <i>vitamins,
                minerals, foods, emotions, parasites, stressors associated with
                diseases, allergies, hormonal imbalances, parasites, pathogens,
                Candida, celiac “leaky gut,”, premature aging, blood, brain,
                perverse energies, vision</i>, and other areas. </p>
            <p>The device is FDA recognized. The basis of the <span class="style6">INDIGO
                </span> device is the ability to measure the client's energy
              pattern and balance aberrations in the energy field. Not only does
              the device pick up on these frequencies, it has the capacity to
              send the frequency <i>back </i> through the electrodes of the
              device, thereby helping balance any energetic disturbance or
              stressors that may be occurring along the energetic pathway. </p>
            <p><i>DISCLAIMER: This device is to be used as a biofeedback and
                stress reduction system only. It is designed for stress
                deduction and stress reduction. This device does not diagnose or
                treat illness. Only a licensed medical practitioner may diagnose
                and treat an illness. </i></p>
            <p>Health is the ease of energy flow; disease is a disruption in the
              flow. The best use of this device is unblocking any obstructions
              in flow. </p>
            <p>The <span class="style6">INDIGO </span> system is calibrated to
              measure the very fine electrical and subspace reactions to a group
              of biological and medical substances. All remedies are
              homeopathic. The sensitivity is so fine as to pick up on the
              earliest signs of stress.</p>

            <hr>
            <p><b>NANDA JONES </b> has been a licensed massage therapist of 25
              years, a practitioner of 2nd degree Reiki, and taught reflexology
              and shiatsu at the School of Chinese Medicine in Wichita, KS. <br>
              <br>
              A mother and grandmother, Nanda co-authored two holistic
              cookbooks, is ordained to perform weddings, and opened and managed
              a holistic restaurant at a medical facility in Wichita for 7
              years. </p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>“When I first heard of the <span class="style6">INDIGO </span>
                biofeedback system I was intrigued because of my background as a
                massage therapist and my keen interest in energy medicine.
                However, I was somewhat skeptical. Upon exploration I discovered
                that the system not only worked, based on talks with people who
                had experienced it, but it worked well! A good friend decided to
                invest in the <span class="style6">INDIGO </span> – and me,
                and after my initial training I started to use it on myself.” </p>
              <p>“There have been few experiences that have made such a
                physiological change in my life. <i></i>I think that the <span
                  class="style6">INDIGO </span> energetic feedback system has a
                solid future, and I recommend it for anyone who would like
                comprehensive overview of their mental, physical, emotional and
                spiritual health.” <br>
