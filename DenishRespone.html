    <p><em>E-mail response to NM Lt. Gov and declared Gubernatorial candidate Diane Denish, in response to her fundraising e-mail below... </em></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>I&rsquo;m very aware that   you&rsquo;re running for Governor, because I keep reading about the incessant   fundraisers. Do you suppose you&rsquo;ve got enough money in the bank, enough of a   lead in fundraising, to consider how rotten is this system of private,   competitive, constant fundraising?</p>
    <p>I don&rsquo;t plan to vote   for any candidate (even my favorite Democratic and liberal ones) who doesn&rsquo;t   stop and think and take a stand for public campaign financing. I would like a   little representation here too, and would like to see you-all have a little time   for study, contemplation, governing, and looking out for MY interests &ndash; which   you must know is inhibited when you have to spend ALL your time fundraising. And   it would be cheaper for all of us that way, as you must   know.</p>
    <p>So please take me off   your list, and let me know if and when you decide to speak out for public   campaign financing. I&rsquo;m not just picking on you (although you&rsquo;re in the best   position to take the lead on this) &ndash; I&rsquo;ve &ldquo;editorialized&rdquo; on this frequently.&nbsp;   This is 2007 already &ndash; let&rsquo;s get with it. Best   wishes.</p>
    <p>P.S. My name is not   James.</p>

              <p>Dear   James,</p>
              <p>You   may have heard over the last couple of weeks that there are several people who   said they are &quot;exploring&quot; a run for Governor.&nbsp;I, however, do not need to explore   the idea of running for Governor; I am running and want to be the next Governor   of New Mexico.</p>
              <div>
                <p>You can go to <a title="http://salsa.wiredforchange.com/dia/track.jsp?v=2&amp;c=sS6KElq8N8+93Q85Ff1/BaB5UL3mPiwi" href="http://salsa.wiredforchange.com/dia/track.jsp?v=2&amp;c=sS6KElq8N8%2B93Q85Ff1%2FBaB5UL3mPiwi">www.dianedenish.com</a> and make a contribution or sign up to be a Friend of   Diane.</p>

              <div>
                <p>One of the things some of these   almost candidates are talking about is that they want to make government more   transparent.&nbsp;They can talk all they want, but I am doing   it!&nbsp;</p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <p>During the 2009 Legislative Session   I pushed for several reforms that would make our government more   transparent.&nbsp;</p>
              </div>
              <ul type="disc">
                <li><strong>Transparency in   Contracting:</strong>&nbsp;I pushed for a law that requires   all state contracts to be posted on the internet, so that the public can know   how their tax dollars are being spent. </li>
              </ul>
              <ul type="disc">
                <li><strong>Campaign Finance   Transparency:</strong>&nbsp;I fought for a law that would   provide more transparency on campaign fundraising, by requiring candidates to   file online reports every quarter. &nbsp;&nbsp;<em>This is   something I do voluntarily every three months on my campaign web   site!</em> </li>
              </ul>
              <ul type="disc">
                <li><strong>Regional Housing   Authority Reform:</strong>&nbsp;I wrote and passed a law to   systematically reform New   Mexico's Regional Housing Authorities, to ensure that   tax payers get the most effective government possible, at the lowest possible   price. </li>
              </ul>
              <ul type="disc">
                <li><strong>Increasing Public   Access to Public Information: </strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;I pushed for legislation that   would shorten the amount of time the government has to respond to requests for   public records, and make it harder to suppress information in those   documents. </li>
              </ul>
              <div>
