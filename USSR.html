              <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> These photos 
              of Soviet and American people were taken (in 3-D "stereo") in 1982, 
              distributed as "ViewMaster"-like stereo sets to many top U.S. government 
              officials and agencies, published as calendars in 1985 and 1987 
              and given to all US Senators &amp; Representatives, in an attempt 
              to "humanize" Soviet people and emphasize our commonality &nbsp;in 
              those Cold War days. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">These photos
