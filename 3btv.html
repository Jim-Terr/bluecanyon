          <p>Thirteen short films by Santa Fe documentary and video producer

          featured on the 3btv site. Although the “Jim Terr

          <br>
          <br>
          Jim Terr produces documentaries as well as comedy shorts, and (like
          everyone) hopes to produce features. A political animal, Terr sings
          and records many satires at <a href="http://www.bluecanyonsatire.com/">www.BlueCanyonSatire.com </a>.

          often. </p>
        <p>A film and stage actor, he enjoys using actor friends in his short
          films, as well as bringing out the talent in &quot;inexperienced&quot; talent,
          <u>creating custom short films for anyone who wants to be in a film
          and can pay for it</u>! <br>
