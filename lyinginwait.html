      JT:  Hello, I&rsquo;m Jim Terr, a familiar face I hope, and producer of scores  of documentaries that have been useful are acclaimed for their  rock-solid impartiality, and the subject of several news reports  myself. I wanted to take a look for myself at claims by the  administration and numerous commentators that there  is a vast  liberal conspiracy of ill-intentioned malcontents tearing America  down and, even worse, lying in wait to fight over the pickings when  America finally crumbles. <br/>
  <br/>
      (<em>Trump </em><em>video</em><em> re &ldquo;they want chaos&rdquo;.</em>.)  Is there really  a cabal of America-hating, news-faking, gay-promoting, gun-banning,  history-erasing, military-bashing, abortion-loving, weather-hoaxing  chaos lovers responsible for all that&rsquo;s going wrong with out  country? Stay tuned for my findings – I think you&rsquo;ll be amazed.  (fade to black).<br/>
  <br/>
      (<em>Dana L</em><em>oe</em><em>sch </em><em>video </em><em>excerpt..</em>). Is there really a liberal plot to destroy our  country? You bet there is, and I was able to locate it, and even get  interviews with some of the major players. Surprisingly, they&rsquo;re  not shy or secretive in talking about it. <br/>
  <br/>
      (enter  store…)<br/>
  <br/>
      FAMILY VALUES</p>
    <p><br/>
    </p>
    <p>Nancy?:  Yes, I&rsquo;m a senior strategist in the <strong>Family Values department</strong>.  Destroying them, that is (shots of snider comedy items). I&rsquo;ve  always hated families, especially my own. Never had kids, think it&rsquo;s  a bad idea. Families? The only family is the world-wide network of  like-minded folks sharing equally among ourselves, with no greedy  people and corporations taking all the money. One world – yeah –  that&rsquo;s the ticket. But where was I? Family values – no value.  Well, I&rsquo;ve gotta get back to work. <br/>
      <br/>
      JT: As you can see,  like I said, no concealment about the mission there. Let&rsquo;s move on. <br/>
  <br/>
      GUNS:</p>
    <p><br/>
    </p>
    <p>Jose  Maestas?: Yeah, I was in the army. Vietnam. I&rsquo;ve come to see it as  a cynical effort to use poor boys like me to prop up dictatorships  and capitalism. I&rsquo;ve used some firearms as you can imagine. I know  they can hurt people – that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re for. That&rsquo;s why we  are planning to take them away, just as the <strong>NRA says. We&rsquo;re  going to melt them all down</strong> to make huge statues of endangered  species. Birds, worms, whatever – as many as it takes to use up all  that metal. <br/>
      <br/>
      JT: No ambiguity there. I reckon. Moving  along…<br/>
  <br/>
      ART/CENSORSHIP:<br/>
  <br/>
      Meredith?: I&rsquo;m an  artist, in several media (show), and I know something about Art. I&rsquo;ve  been designated as the <strong>Minister  of Art</strong>, in waiting. When the revolution comes, all  decisions about art and what&rsquo;s not will come right though here.  Movies, books, paintings, cartoons – if they don&rsquo;t pass the test  of being non-offensive, non-upsetting, and respectful of the female  spirit and the spirit of all the beautiful peoples of the world, NO  GO JACK. It&rsquo;ll be a happier world. Minister of Art, watch for me. <br/>
  <br/>
      JT A strong stand. Gotta admire that. <br/>
  <br/>
      FAKE  NEWS<br/>
  <br/>
      Jason?: <strong>Fake news </strong>is no joke, and nothing  imaginary. And the Russians have very little to do with it. It all  starts right here. Our staff determines what issues are most divisive  in this country, and we put out rumors and stories that will appeal  to people&rsquo;s worst instincts and tear this country apart even more.  The President, for instance. It&rsquo;s hard to find any weak points in  this guy, but we find them and keep hammering away, chipping away.  When it all crumbles, we&rsquo;ll be around to pick up the pieces.  Anyhow, if you&rsquo;ll excuse me, I&rsquo;ve gotta get back to work. </p>
    <p><br/>
    </p>
    <p>GAY  AGENDA</p>
    <p><br/>
    </p>
    <p>Kayt?:  You&rsquo;ve heard of the <strong>gay agenda?</strong> Hell, there&rsquo;s no gay  agenda..   Just kidding – of course there is! I won&rsquo;t be happy  til all the so-called male and female roles are ground down to dust  and buried where they belong. Kids don&rsquo;t need male and female role  models. &ldquo;Mom&rdquo; and &ldquo;Dad&rdquo; - FEH! Any one or two good human  beings will do the trick. More gays on TV, movies, in the White House  – we&rsquo;ll be there before you know it….  By the way, I&rsquo;m gonna  be Minister of Gender when the time comes – so watch out!!</p>
    <p><br/>
    </p>
    <p>JT:  wow. Let&rsquo;s move on…<br/>
      <br/>
      CLIMATE CHANGE</p>
    <p><br/>
    </p>
    <p>Wid?:  President Trump and a few others say <strong>Climate Change</strong> is a  Chinese Hoax. It&rsquo;s no Chinese and I resent that. I&rsquo;ve been  co-ordinating the Climate Change Hoax back since when we &ldquo;educated&rdquo;  Al Gore on it, ten or 15 years ago.  He&rsquo;s helped us spread this  rumor very effectively. It&rsquo;s all about trying to destroy American  industry so we can spend more time at home with our families. In  truth, the ice caps are getting bigger if anything. And the  temperature? It&rsquo;s going up – can&rsquo;t anyone read a  thermometer?<br/>
      <br/>
      JT: Hey, OK. <br/>
  <br/>
      CHAOS</p>
    <p><br/>
    </p>
    <p><u>???</u>: <strong>Chaos?</strong>The President says that&rsquo;s what we liberals want, and  he&rsquo;s right about that. Chaos. Disorder. Crime and Protests in the  streets. The more the merrier. You&rsquo;ve heard of Chaos Theory,  haven&rsquo;t you? Well we&rsquo;ve got our own Chaos Theory. Make people  crazy enough and it&rsquo;s easier to take over. Which is what we plan to  do. And when we do, call me, ____.  I&rsquo;ll create a little chaos in  your own life. I&rsquo;m the Master of it. <br/>
      <br/>
      JT: Well, that  explains that.<br/>
  <br/>
      ABORTION</p>
    <p><br/>
    </p>
    <p>____   Abortions. You can&rsquo;t live with em, you can&rsquo;t live without em.  Look, nobody likes abortions. ...Well, on second thought, they&rsquo;re a  real plus. Save everybody a lot of trouble. Life is tragic, something  to be avoided at all costs. If I don&rsquo;t meet my quota of 700,000  abortions a year here in the US, I&rsquo;m not gonna get the job of  Minister of Childbirth as I&rsquo;ve been promised. So, everybody,  abort!<br/>
      <br/>
      JT: A little rough, that one.<br/>
  <br/>
      RE-EDUCATION  CAMPS</p>
    <p><br/>
    </p>
    <p> (M.Eliz, with computers?) Of course, when the revolution comes, or if  we win the 2020 elections, we&rsquo;ll have to find a place to put all  these rednecks for a while to<strong> re-educate</strong> them. I&rsquo;m in charge  of scouting locations in various regions where we can keep these  people for a couple months, or however long it takes. Some of these  people cling very hard to their old-fashioned, outdated values, you  know. </p>
    <p><br/>
      RESPECT  FOR TROOPS</p>
    <p><br/>
    </p>
    <p>_______________  There&rsquo;s entirely too much <strong>respect for troops</strong>. After all,  they just signed up for some adventure or cuz there were no other  jobs for them in this capitalistic economy. Of course that&rsquo;s not  their fault, but I don&rsquo;t think they should be given any special  benefits or advantages when they come back – IF they come back.  I&rsquo;ve got a lot of work to do re-education people about that. That&rsquo;s  my job, in the revolutionary govetnment. <br/>
      <br/>
      BIGGER  GOVERNMENT</p>
    <p><br/>
    </p>
    <p>____________________  Til we can achieve a true one-world government, we can at least  increase the government&rsquo;s role here at home, starting with health  care and health insurance. I think that health decisions can best be  made by government bureaucrats. There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with  government bureaucrats – they&rsquo;re more talented than most people  think. And of course those &ldquo;death panel&rdquo; decisions should be  decided by even higher-level bureaucrats. <br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      TAXES /  WELFARE</p>
    <p><br/>
    </p>
    <p>_____________________   I&rsquo;m all in favor of people wanting to work. I work, in fact. But  while I can spare a minute, I&rsquo;ll tell you frankly that those who  want to just lie around and have babies have as much right to survive  as anyone, and if I have to <strong>pay more taxes for their benefit </strong>–  and especially if YOU do, well, that&rsquo;s called redistribution of  wealth, and I&rsquo;m all for it. I&rsquo;ll be the new Minister of Welfare,  come the revolution. <br/>
      <br/>
      LESS IS MORE</p>
    <p><br/>
    </p>
    <p>________________________  The world has gotten way too industrialized. Too much technology. We  favor a return to the earth, <strong>a strictly vegetarian diet,</strong> smaller vehicles and prefereably bicycles, 95% of transportantion  should be public. Smaller is better. Mandatory gym and fitness  classes. A weak population is an unfit population.</p>
    <p><br/>
    </p>
    <p>OPEN  BORDERS &amp; RACE<br/>
      <br/>
    __________________________________  Of  course we need open borders. We stole this land and now it&rsquo;s only  fair that somebody else steal it from us. Survival of the fittest.  And we need more rainbow families and rainbow couples and rainbow  people cuz all-white is boring.</p></td>
