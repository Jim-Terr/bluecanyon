                  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>PROFESSOR 
                  HERBERT F. ZIEGLER</b>, University of Hawaii</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I'm teaching 
                  history of the Holocaust here, in the University of Hawaii, 
                  once a year. One of the first issues that always comes up with 
                  my students, is &quot;how do we know about the Holocaust.&quot; 
                  And on the surface, the answer is a simple one. We have all 
                  sorts of information. But then, if you dig a little deeper, 
                  it becomes obvious that much of our information, actually, comes 
                  from records and documents that we accumulated. Documents about 
                  the perpetrators of the Holocaust. I think it is very important, 
                  for better understanding of the Holocaust, that when we talk 
                  about sources about the Holocaust that we also know about the 
                  side of the victims.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is very 
                  important, therefore, that people who have survived the Holocaust 
                  tell us their story. A story that is obviously very painful. 
                  Not everyone can tell it, but I think subsequent generations 
                  will not only be grateful, but terribly appreciative that we 
                  have that side of the story. In my class, we are keenly aware 
                  that there are different sources of information. And those who 
                  survived the Holocaust constitute one key important source.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The danger 
                  is that the perpetrator's record, which, in large part comes 
                  through testimony from trials, and so forth, is that a perpetrator 
                  is obviously likely to tell his side of the story, which isn't 
                  always necessarily the truth. Especially if you are in a court 
                  of law and you're facing prison terms, and executions. Clearly, 
                  you tell a story that is rather self-serving. So that's one 
                  problem, I think.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There are 
                  other sources, like documents, memoranda, and so forth, that 
                  we can analyze and sift through and evaluate. But, again, I 
                  think that if we just use one side of the story, I think we 
                  get a warped picture here. I think it's not the whole picture 
                  that we're after.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Personally, 
                  I only know one survivor, myself, and he is, in fact, rather 
                  reluctant to talk about it. I know for a fact that there are 
                  survivors living in Hawaii, but none of whom I am aware of are 
                  actually willing to speak up. I would be interested, for instance, 
                  to have somebody speak to my students in my class, but nobody 
                  is really willing, at least in this community, to do that. Understandably 
                  so, but nevertheless, it's sort of a problem. It's important 
                  to get as much evidence from those who are willing to talk.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I think 
                  that the issue of continuing danger depends a little bit more 
                  on where they might live. I think the real issue is having to 
                  re-live, repeatedly, the horrible experience, and bring back 
                  memories that can only be painful. I think it's just human nature, 
                  generally speaking, that you probably, for the most part, don't 
                  want to do that. I think there are exceptions, however. I do 
                  think that people who have survived--who think however painful 
                  it is, they have an obligation to tell the story. And while 
                  it may be personally painful for them to tell the story and 
                  re-tell the story, they nevertheless want to play the role of 
                  the witness and remind the rest of us what happened in the past.</font></p>

                  <b>ZINA BIRNBERG</b></font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I was 2 
                  years old at the time and I was walking with my mother, and 
                  I saw a child near a door lying down, and I didn't understand 
                  what it was. But later, I realized, and the memory doesn't leave 
                  me alone. The Christian people-the Polaks, killed a Christian 
                  child, threw it at a Jewish door, and then they made a pogrom. 
                  A pogrom means an attack on the Jewish people. Whoever had the 
                  chance at the time to hide to run to hiding places, the rest 
                  of the Jewish people were killed by the Polaks. They said that 
                  the Jewish people killed a Christian child, and that's why all 
                  the Jewish people have to be killed. And that memory doesn't 
                  leave me alone. It must have been in 1935 or '36. No, before 
                  that, we had a Polish president, Pilsucski was his name. And 
                  he didn't allow the Polaks to kill Jewish people or threaten 
                  us, nor do anything bad. They did bad things anyway, but not 
                  as much as they wanted to.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One day, 
                  it must have in 1935 or 36, I'm not sure, I was passing by a 
                  street and I saw a lot of people standing there and crying. 
                  I soon found out that somebody killed the President, Pilsucski. 
                  And everybody was crying, and it was terrible. A short time 
                  later, the Polish people made another President-a German-I forgot 
                  his name right now. I always remembered it, right now I forgot. 
                  Ahhh, Smigli Ridz. And he became the President of Poland. And 
                  then the Polish people had freedom to do what they wanted to. 
                  To attack us from everywhere whenever they wanted and how they 
                  wanted.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 1939, 
                  all of a sudden a bird flew into our house&#133;..No, before 
                  that. In 1939 we lived in a street that was close to another 
                  German and Polish people. And it was just very close before 
                  the war started. Just before they created the ghetto. A group 
                  of Polish people, and maybe even German people with them, started 
                  to scream, &quot;Let's kill those Jews here. There is a Jewish 
                  family here, let's kill them, let's kill them. My oldest brother 
                  was a great actor and singer and he knew a lot of things. He 
                  was a high officer in the Polish Army, which for Jewish people 
                  was impossible. When he heard all of those screams he imitated 
                  voices. He imitated about 8 to 10 voices, and each person had 
                  a different thing to say about how to let those Polish people 
                  have it. And they got scared to death and they ran away.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Shortly 
                  after that we had to move to another area where the ghetto was 
                  supposed to be later. We moved out of that area and my brother 
                  came home for a short time. I saw a bird flew into our apartment 
                  and it flew around and I knew that my brother is coming. Since 
                  I was eleven years old I had dreams, premonitions and visions. 
                  So I foresaw the future, and in that time during the War it 
                  was the worst time to have those things, because I saw everything 
                  before it happened. And when my brother came home he asked me 
                  to go to his fianc&eacute;e and tell her that he came home. 
                  When I walked there, a group of German boys in teams of 20's 
                  stopped me and they told me to&#133;..ah, ahhhhh&#133;.I'm nervous, 
                  I forget what I am saying. To pull their&#133;.I forgot what 
                  it's called&#133;.To pull their slate. I understood German , 
                  every word, but I didn't say. And I kept telling them &quot;I 
                  don't understand. Say it in Polish.&quot; But they wouldn't 
                  until one guy grabbed me by the arm and put this cord of the 
                  slate in my hands to pull them. I didn't do it. I kept on going 
                  until I came to the proper place where I wanted to come, and 
                  then they let me go. On my way home, I saw a place where they 
                  were selling bread&#133;A German place, and I stopped to buy 
                  bread. I heard somebody scream, &quot;There's a Jewish woman 
                  here, there's a Jewish woman here.&quot; And the Germans started 
                  to look for the woman and somebody pulled her out, and she was 
                  crying and begging telling them she's not Jewish. But they took 
                  her away anyway. I thought they meant me, but I don't look Jewish. 
                  So no one ever bothered me.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Then, at 
                  a short time my brother left for Russia, and after that, we 
                  never saw him again. A short time after that, they closed the 
                  ghetto. The ghetto is like a concentration camp, but in that 
                  place the families stay together. Everybody stayed together. 
                  We were selected. So, they closed the ghetto in the very beginning 
                  of 1940, and a short time after that, maybe in early March, 
                  my father&#133;.I was sitting in the windowsill and just looking, 
                  and all of a sudden I saw my father coming towards me and eating 
                  a carrot. And I screamed, &quot;father, father, father.&quot; 
                  He didn't hear me and I kept on calling him and then he disappeared, 
                  like into the air. And I knew that my father is dying. I short 
                  time after that, maybe about 2 weeks later, he came home and 
                  went to bed. And he was in bed for about a week. And one day 
                  he started to call me, &quot;Faigale, Faigale, chase away the 
                  devils, chase away the devils,&quot; and things like that. And 
                  I didn't understand what was going on. And I was begging him, 
                  &quot;Father, there's no one here.&quot; Then my mother came 
                  in and sent me on an errand, and I, instead of walking, I just 
                  ran as fast as I could. And about ten minutes later I came back. 
                  My father was dead.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When the 
                  Nazis walked in, before all of that happened. When the Nazi's 
                  walked in in September, 1939, they were singing songs. Although 
                  it was in German, I could understand every word. I just understood 
                  because I speak Jewish. They were singing, &quot;We are taking 
                  Poland. We will take America. We will take the whole world, 
                  and we will slice open the American-Jewish bellies, and we will 
                  take their gold, their silver, and everything else they have, 
                  because it all belongs to us.&quot; I can never forget those 
                  songs and those words, and how they spoke, because I understood 
                  every single word. When the ghetto closed after my father died, 
                  my youngest brother got sick and he died from starvation. There 
                  was a close family-there were 4 people, and they were in the 
                  ghetto together with us and we were very close. One day I found 
                  out where they lived and went to visit. The parents had already 
                  died. The two sisters were left alive. One was laying in bed, 
                  and the other one was sitting next to her. When I came up, I 
                  wanted to say hello, and sit by the sick girl by her bed, and 
                  the other one chased me away. She screamed, &quot;Don't touch 
                  her.&quot; I noticed that she had lice on her body. Her eyes 
                  were closed and they were full of lice, and she died a short 
                  time after that. And then the older sister died of the same 
                  problem.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">People were 
                  starving and dying in the streets, especially in the wintertime. 
                  They were falling like flies all over the street, and lying 
                  dead. There were special things where you take the garbage away-I 
                  don't know what there were called. Young boys were&#133;.It 
                  was like a round can like for garbage. And young boys were carrying 
                  that to throw the bodies in. One was for the garbage, the other 
                  one was for the bodies. Those bodies were mostly thrown into 
                  big groups and they were put on piles to burn them.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Then we 
                  started to have selections. The first selection, they were taking 
                  away young children and women. All the people and young children. 
                  I was not a young child, but I was only 12 or 13 years old at 
                  the time, and I was not very healthy. The first year in the 
                  ghetto I just got very very sick and I almost died. So my mother 
                  and my younger sister and I were hiding in a rooftop, and I 
                  saw a little window, and I laid down and looked out through 
                  that window, and I saw one of the trucks that had the people 
                  from the selection on the truck. It was not a truck; it was 
                  a wagon with two horses. And one of those people, one man, tried 
                  to escape, and they caught him and tied his feet to the wagon, 
                  and his body was hanging down and his head was bumping against 
                  the concrete. There was a long sign of blood from his head. 
                  Those things were horrible to watch. After that the selections 
                  continued.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One day, 
                  I was caught, and my older brother was caught in that selection. 
                  My older brother managed to escape and he ran into a building 
                  and he hid in that building. The Germans were chasing him, and 
                  they found another man. They didn't find him. He came home alive, 
                  and I was taken to a special place, to a hospital out of the 
                  ghetto and I was put in a room. The first floor in Poland was 
                  like the second floor here. I was in a room with a lot of other 
                  people. There was only standing room. I was standing by a wall, 
                  and I was praying for hours. All I wanted to do was go home 
                  and see my mother one more time, and then I didn't care if I 
                  died. That ordeal was early in the morning, and about late afternoon 
                  I managed to get out of that room. I went over to the door and 
                  there was a little window and I looked out, and one of the workers 
                  asked me if I wanted to go to the bathroom, and I said &quot;Yes.&quot; 
                  So she let me out, and I saw a woman with a young girl talking 
                  to a policeman so I hid behind them. I was very small. And when 
                  they walked down I walked down beside them and I managed to 
                  run out and I ran as fast as I could because I was wearing wooden 
                  shoes that were about two sizes too big for me. I managed to 
                  get behind the morgue (?) and I stood there for a while, and 
                  there were a lot of other people hiding there. They heard me 
                  and they thought it might have been a Nazi, so they were quiet, 
                  and they didn't know what to do. Then somebody asked, &quot;who 
                  is there,&quot; and I didn't answer until I saw who was talking, 
                  and I came out. And when the guard changed, the people started 
                  to talk about running away, and I saw one and two and three 
                  people run away, so I run after them, and I run out. And a German 
                  Nazi grabbed me by the arm and kept me, but I managed to slide 
                  out of his arm and I ran away, and I ran home. It took many 
                  hours, because in-between I had to hide by small buildings-entrances 
                  to courtyards where like a big opening, and the doors were closed, 
                  so I used to hide in these places, until I came home late at 
                  night. No one expected me to be alive.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The horrors 
                  in the ghetto continued and the selections continued for a long 
                  time. In the beginning of 1944, we hid in a basement. It was 
                  a very deep hole in the ground. It wasn't really a basement. 
                  We were hiding there for about a week, or maybe ten days. My 
                  older sister would go out and try to find some food until it 
                  was impossible to keep on staying there, and we came out and 
                  went to where the German guards were, and we were sent to Auschwitz.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When we 
                  came close to the trains, there were a lot of Gestapo men with 
                  dogs-German Shepherds-and they were pushing us up on the trains, 
                  and we were so crowded that one person stood practically on 
                  top of the other. Many people died from starvation, from the 
                  heat of being so close to one another. They died standing up. 
                  They couldn't fall down. There was no room to fall down.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On the trains 
                  that I was on, and my mother, and a big part of my family. We 
                  were a very large family. And a lot of people died standing 
                  up. Then, when we finally came down from the trains, there was 
                  a selection. My mother was taken away and one of my nephews-my 
                  older sister's boy, with my mother. And they were taken away. 
                  My sister had twins, and they were taken away-my oldest sister. 
                  I had a very large family. Most of them were taken away to the 
                  ovens. A short time later, we stood there. I stood there and 
                  I watched the ashes from the oven where my family went to. And 
                  I just couldn't take it. I ran after my mother when they took 
                  her, but my older sister grabbed me by the arm and she said, 
                  &quot;Stay here. Don't move.&quot; And she held me by the arm. 
                  She wouldn't let me go. She saved my life.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After that, 
                  we went into a room where they were bathing. So we stood on 
                  the cold shower, and then we were given concentration camp clothes. 
                  The clothes consisted of one dress, nothing else. And a pair 
                  of wooden shoes. And the ones I got were two sizes two big on 
                  my feet. From there, we were in a camp, in a room. We were laying 
                  on the floor, like herring, or sardines, so close on after the 
                  other. One woman just coughed and she was taken out and put 
                  out on the table and beaten to death. I will never forget that. 
                  How could people do that? No matter who they are or what they 
                  are, how can one woman kill another woman, with her hands and 
                  with other things, just because she was Jewish? Those were horrible 
                  times.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Then, we 
                  went through many selections. After the selections, we were 
                  put in a place where it was only electric fence in an empty 
                  place. It was a very large place, and we were only women, and 
                  a lot of use were very very young, and we stayed there for 3 
                  days and nights, naked, without any clothes or anything on us. 
                  Just like we were born. Outside. If it was raining, or the wind 
                  was blowing, or it was very cold, we just stood there like that 
                  for three days and three nights. And then we came out. There 
                  were some women that just couldn't take anymore and they threw 
                  themselves on the fence and started to burn. There was, not 
                  ashes, but like smoke, coming from their mouth. And those stories 
                  are just horrible to remember and to tell. We were in Auschwitz 
                  and Birkenau both, for about a week or ten days, and then we 
                  were put on trucks and were taken to another place, a factory 
                  for German ammunition. When we came to that factory, there was 
                  a very large room, and there were a lot of men and there were 
                  two on tables. Those men were Italian men. Not the Italians 
                  that worked with Mussolini. Those Italians were good people. 
                  They were also in concentration camps, but they had a lot of 
                  freedom, not like we were. And they gave us food before we went 
                  into the camps. We just couldn't believe it. It was impossible 
                  to believe that after all of those horrors, that I just spoke 
                  a few of them, that the men still were human beings, because 
                  I didn't believe that there were any left. They gave us food 
                  and they were very, very nice to us.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When we 
                  came to the camps, we walked by ammunition machines. I had to 
                  stand on a chair because I was too short to be able to reach 
                  any of the machines. But I managed, and I worked very good. 
                  And one of the Italian men came over. He called me &quot;Piccollo 
                  Bambino&quot;. Which means little baby. And he asked me to marry 
                  him. I was only 16 years old. That was in the beginning of 1945. 
                  And I told him &quot;No. I can't marry you. I am Jewish and 
                  I will stay Jewish.&quot; So he left. But he never forgot me, 
                  and I never forgot him. He told me that any time, if I would 
                  like to come to Italy, he gave me his address and his family 
                  name, and he asked me to come and visit him. But I never went 
                  back. I didn't think of it, but I never forgot him, because 
                  he was so nice. In 1945, May 8th, the day Hitler capitulated, 
                  Czechoslovakian partisans took us out about 12:00 o'clock noon, 
                  and we marched with them to Czechoslovakia. It was about 7 or 
                  8 kilometers from the border. There were lots of sick people 
                  and they were put on trucks, and they also went to Czechoslovakia 
                  to the hospitals. That same night, the German soldiers on their 
                  way back from the fighting, stopped at that camp and they meant 
                  to kill us all. But we had already left.</font></p>
                <p></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>
                  So we stayed in Czechoslovakia for a while, and the people were 
                  very nice&#133;.We stayed in a school for a few days, and then 
                  we were taken to private homes. And the people were very, very 
                  nice to us. The Czechoslovakian people. I will never forget 
                  them. About three weeks later, or maybe a month later, we decided, 
                  I was with two sisters-my older sister that grabbed me by the 
                  arm, and my younger sister. We decided to go back home to Poland 
                  and see if we could find any family. On the way back, we went 
                  to a road that was near &#133;&#133;..Oh I forget everything&#133;..It 
                  was a big place with a lot of trees, and as we were walking 
                  my sister with her friend went away. They wanted to look around 
                  the area. I was left with my younger sister.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As my younger 
                  sister and I were walking near the forest, we saw my sister 
                  and her friend coming back. And at the same time, a Jeep with 
                  four soldiers&#133;not soldiers, but officers, were driving 
                  close to us. When my sister came towards us with her friend&#133;..Before 
                  that, before my sister and her friend&#133;.the Jeep came close 
                  towards us. The Polish people came out from the forest and they 
                  were going to take us into the forest&#133;.My younger sister 
                  and me. So, my sister saw what was happening and she went over 
                  to the Jeep and she spoke to one of the officer's, the major 
                  officer. He was much more than an officer, but I don't remember 
                  the rank. And she told him what was happening and he came out 
                  and stopped those Polish men and they went back into the forest, 
                  and we went free. And then we started walking ? the train, because 
                  my younger sister and I didn't know where it was.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We were 
                  were walking towards the train until we found it and the train 
                  was full of Polish people. Different kind of people, and they 
                  were driving back to Poland. On the way, we had to change trains, 
                  and they were all Polish. And by the time we came back it was 
                  late night. We found a place and we stayed there. My sister 
                  found a man that she was talking to, and they went walking, 
                  and we stayed in a place. We had to transfer to another place 
                  where the Jewish community where. My sister didn't know where 
                  we were, and we didn't know where she was. She went with that 
                  man. A few days later, they got married.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">My younger 
                  sister and I were walking and we found a temporary Jewish community-a 
                  place where we took our names. And we stayed there. There was 
                  a special room for people to sleep on the floor. So we stayed 
                  there. My brother-in-law a few days later came to look for us, 
                  and he took us to their apartment. The apartment was in what 
                  was called &quot;The Balut&quot;&#133;in not such a good area. 
                  Most of the people there were Polish or German. The apartment 
                  that they found was where a German family used to live. So we 
                  stayed in that apartment and one day I was looking out the window 
                  and there was a bunch of boys downstairs, and they called me 
                  &quot;German&quot;, something or other. And I opened the window 
                  and said, &quot;I am not German,&quot; and I spoke to them in 
                  Jewish. So they asked me to please come down, and I came down. 
                  And they told me there was a kibbutz, and they asked me to join 
                  the kibbutz. A kibbutz is a group of people that we stay together, 
                  we live together. Not boys and girls together, but girls together, 
                  and boys separate, but in the same building. We were training 
                  to do different things, and we were walking during the daytime, 
                  and we were supposed to go to Israel.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One day, 
                  I was walking in the street and a Polish car, not a car, there 
                  were no cars-a horse and buggy were driving past us and they 
                  stopped when they saw us. And they asked us if they saw any 
                  Jews around because they had to kill the rest of them. We said 
                  &quot;No&quot;, and we kept on walking. We came to the kibbutz; 
                  we walked in factories and different places. About a few months 
                  later, we were getting ready to leave Poland. So we had to train 
                  to speak another language. It was Turkish. We changed our names 
                  and we only spoke a few words, like our names and five-six words 
                  that we knew and that's all. Just the get through the borders. 
                  We went on a train and came out of Poland and we came to Germany. 
                  We stayed with the kibbutz in Germany and we also walked, but 
                  we had free time. During the free times, a few kids, me included, 
                  made a big garden. And I asked them to make a Star of David 
                  in the garden. And we made a Star of David in the Garden. We 
                  were in Germany for about 9 months or a year, and then we went 
                  into a place close to the border of France, near the ocean. 
                  We stayed there for a while, and from there, we took the ship-it 
                  wasn't a ship, it was a boat-where we went with 1300 people 
                  on that boat to go to Israel illegally. We were caught in mid-ocean 
                  by the British and were taken to a camp. We were taken to Cypress. 
                  We stayed in Cypress for 7 months in prison.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After we 
                  came out, we were taken to Israel to another camp, &quot;Atlit&quot;. 
                  It was also a prison. We stayed in that prison for 2 months. 
                  Not all of us, because a lot of the people in Cypress came earlier, 
                  and they left earlier. So we stayed in that camp for 2 months, 
                  and then we went to kibbutz Kinosar (sp?) in Israel, in the 
                  Galilee, and we stayed there. When the Arabs started to attack 
                  us and the War broke out, there were a lot of horrible stories. 
                  The Arabs caught a very young boy-he was 11 years old-and they 
                  castrated him alive. They caught some other boys and did the 
                  same things. They caught a girl and they raped her en masse 
                  and let her lay there until she died. There were a lot of horrible 
                  things. And then they were shooting at us. But the Jewish people 
                  were very, very smart. The Israeli Jewish people. They took 
                  from the civilians from whatever they could get-Jeeps-and they 
                  closed them with windows so they would look like Panthers-a 
                  fighting truck during the war. And they took together between 
                  6 to 12 of those Jeeps and they were driving from one kibbutz 
                  to the next, back and forth. The Arabs saw them going back and 
                  forth and they look like Army. They were dressed like soldiers. 
                  And they looked like Army jeeps with soldiers in them, so the 
                  Arabs got scared and they ran away. There were about 12 Arab 
                  villages and they ran away. Otherwise, they would have killed 
                  us all.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">So we survived, 
                  and then the War started a short time after that. I have a picture 
                  with a rifle in my arms. I was guard at night. We stayed in 
                  the kibbutz for, I don't remember how long. And then, I found 
                  out that my brothers are alive and they are in another kibbutz 
                  and they asked us to come and stay with them together.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We left 
                  and went to the other kibbutz to join our two brothers-three 
                  brothers, actually. And my older sister was left in Poland. 
                  It was just me and my younger sister. So we stayed in that kibbutz, 
                  and then the War started. The 1948 War about Israel against 
                  the Arabs. The Arabs were constantly attacking us from all sides, 
                  and we had to fight back. Whatever ammunition the Jewish people 
                  had in the kibbutzim or in private homes, the English soldiers 
                  confiscated everything we had. But we had to fight back, and 
                  the Jewish people knew how to do things. They really were very, 
                  very smart-the Israeli soldiers. And with as little ammunition 
                  as we had, we managed to fight back. It didn't take very long 
                  until the Arabs just left us free. They didn't have ammunition, 
                  they didn't have anything, but they drove Jeeps at night. So 
                  the Arabs thought that there was a big Army and they got scared 
                  and vanished from different places. Israel became a State. I 
                  think I can stop here.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The people 
                  that deny that the Holocaust ever happened, they are Nazis. 
                  Most of them are German Nazis. But a lot of them are also Polish 
                  Nazis that were against us forever. Always and forever. And 
                  they deny it, but it is the truth. Six million people died-most 
                  of them in Auschwitz, or Birkenau. And a lot of other camps, 
                  like Treblinka. Those camps were all real death camps, and there's 
                  no denial about that, because there's a lot of documentation 
                  in different places. In New York, in Washington, everywhere, 
                  that it is true. There's no denying it.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I was there, 
                  and I know what was going on, and I know what the Nazis could 
                  do and what the Polish people did together with them. And there's 
                  no denying it. It was all true, and so much more. I only told 
                  a very short story of the real story that I could tell. And 
                  it would take days, and it would take weeks to tell my story. 
                  But I made it short. And it's all true.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When the 
                  war started, it was a very bad war. We had no ammunition, but 
                  the Jewish soldiers and the Israeli soldiers mostly, --The Jewish 
                  soldiers--I am talking about the survivors of the Holocaust--together 
                  with the Israeli soldiers, managed to fight back. And it was 
                  just&#133;&#133;We had many miracles to win that war. It was 
                  an impossible thing to do, but we managed to do it. The Israeli 
                  soldiers were very smart, and very handy with things to show 
                  that they have, which they didn't have. And the Arabs were just 
                  too afraid. They showed their strength, but they don't have 
                  any. If they had physical strength, they don't have any emotional 
                  strength. They're too much afraid, and they're still are like 
                  that. And if Israel things that if they give away a lot of land 
                  they will ever get peace, I don't believe it. Because the more 
                  land they will give back to the Arabs, the more the Arabs will 
                  attack the Israeli people. And the more wars there will be. 
                  That is my opinion. I am not sure about it. I have a lot more 
                  to say, but&#133;&#133;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(subsequent 
                  interview):</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When the 
                  Nazis walked in to the lodge, their famous song in German was, 
                  and I understood every single word of it: &quot;We are taking 
                  Poland. We are going to take France and all of Europe. We're 
                  going to take America&#133;&#133;.&quot;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">My first 
                  job in the ghetto was cleaning the ice that accumulated the 
                  whole winter from the streets, with about ten grown men. I was 
                  the only one girl, 12 years old. After that, I got sick, but 
                  that's not important. I had a few jobs after that. My second 
                  job was making braids from straw for boots for the Germans. 
                  And that was also a very hard job. After that, I had a few jobs. 
                  On one of them I was making a small floor mop. It was from thread. 
                  And I couldn't make the straight lines like everybody else made. 
                  I made mountains instead. A commission was there, and they went 
                  around all over to see how the people are working. Mengele, 
                  Hitler's right-hand, stopped by me, and he looked at what I 
                  was doing. He asked me how old I was, I told him. He asked me 
                  if I needed shoes, and I said, &quot;No thank you.&quot; My 
                  shoes had holes all over the place, but I wouldn't ask him for 
                  shoes. Then, he asked me what I was doing. What did I do that 
                  job differently than everybody else&#133;.I said, &quot;I don't 
                  know, I just like it better.&quot; He stood there for a few 
                  minutes and observed what I was doing and he looked at me, and 
                  then he left.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A few days 
                  later, I was transferred to a different job, which I couldn't 
                  do either. And then, my last job was to make silk tablecloths 
                  with a design that each stitch was different from the other. 
                  The design had to be made from a mop. And that was my last job 
                  in the ghetto.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There was 
                  Rumkowski, the President of the ghetto-a Jewish man working 
                  with the Nazis. He was with the police and the fire fighters. 
                  He was making the selections. Not him, personally. He told people 
                  when and how to make the selections. Of course, he got the message 
                  from the Germans first. But he was commanding all of those things. 
                  How and when to do it. Any other things that were supposed to 
                  be done in the ghetto. He thought that he would survive and 
                  he would be a big shot after the war. But he ended up in the 
                  crematoriums just like all of the other 6 million Jewish people 
                  did.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I just knew 
                  who Mengele was. They were talking about him in the ghetto. 
                  I did hear about him. And at that time, my memory was in perfect 
                  condition, not like today. Today, I'm very forgetful.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I heard 
                  his name because after Mengele I was still in the ghetto. I 
                  was working making those tablecloths. I made about 3 of them, 
                  and they were for oval tables, big oval tables. Like flowers, 
                  and leaves. Beautiful, beautiful tablecloths. From silk. And 
                  for that you needed 3 different kinds of needles to do it. You 
                  started up with a needle, I don't know the name of it&#133;..A 
                  little, small thing, just to crochet&#133;crochet needle. Then, 
                  after the crochet needle you have to go to 5 small needles, 
                  and after the 5 small needles, there was a big, round needle&#133;&#133;.And 
                  with that, we made all of those big, beautiful tablecloths. 
                  They had the most beautiful designs of flowers and leaves&#133;. 
                  Just fantastic. I never saw any work like that.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After I 
                  made that, I made a sweater for myself, without any seams. With 
                  pockets that didn't have to be sewn in. They were knit together 
                  in just the most beautiful sweater I've ever seen. But I never 
                  had a chance to wear it.</font><br>
