            <strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">ACTOR TO TACKLE 
            DIFFICULT TASK OF CAPTURING LARGER-THAN-LIFE FIGURE</font></strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
            <br>
            Like that other enduring American institution, the <em>National Enquirer</em>, 
            a lot of people won't admit to liking or even having heard of BuDDy. 
            But, like the <em>Enquirer</em>, BuDDy's popularity and his impact 
            on American culture and entertainment are undeniable.<br>
            <br>
            Even now, five years after his arguably forced retirement from public 
            life, the adulation, the discussions and the controversy continue 
            to swirl around this enormously influential figure -- on radio and 
            TV, in popular and scholarly journals and Internet salons, and around 
            the water cooler. It seems that BuDDy's unprecedented capture of America's 
            heart and imagination may never fade, in spite of his fabled and ill-fated 
            attempt to escape the limelight.<br>
            <br>
            In the tradition of &quot;Chautauqua&quot;-style re-enactments of 
            the lives of famous people, from Hal Holbrook's portrayal of Mark 
            Twain to scores of other historical characters brought to life on 
            stage, singer/songwriter/actor Jim Terr tackles the formidable task 
            of capturing in 70 minutes the truly monumental life of this unique 
            character -- while he's still alive!<br>
            <br>
            One unusual feature of the program is reported to be the inclusion 
            of several famous personalities -- many of whom also do their best 
            to avoid the public eye -- in short video interviews designed to help 
            round out our understanding of this fascinating and enigmatic figure. 
            Interviewees videotaped so far include humorist Dave Barry, <em>Atlantic 
            Monthly</em> national correspondent James Fallows, national talk radio 
            host Jim Bohannon, and journalist Hodding Carter, currently of University 
            of North Carolina / Chapel Hill.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Although he denies any 
            worldly or commercial motives in staging this performance, Terr points 
            out that the most profitable independent motion picture in history, 
            <em>&quot;My Big Fat Greek Wedding&quot;</em>, which has grossed over 
            $350 million to date, originated as a one-woman show, and Terr promises 
            a highly dramatic undertone to his program as well. &quot;In spite 
            of BuDDy's good-old-boy persona and his deceptively simple songs,&quot; 
            Terr says without any apparent irony, &quot;His personal struggles 
            and political impact are on a par with the mightiest dramas of history, 
            stage and cinema.&quot;<br>
            <br>
            Since BuDDy has given his blessing and his hands-off approval to this 
            production, one might realistically expect the famously vain performer 
            to attend one of the premiere performances of this work out of sheer 
            curiosity, adding for the audience a note of excitement and anticipation 
            at the possibility of actually glimpsing this famous recluse -- as 
            well as answering those cynics who have observed that Jim Terr and 
            BuDDy have never been seen in the same place at the same time.</font><br>

          <strong>BEN FRANKLIN...</strong><br>
          <br>
          He was a funny writer, with a . . . taste for pseudonymous pranks;
          he hid his most ascerbic opinions behind the masks of made-up characters.
          But he had world-class ambitions, and he understood that these ambitions
          were probably best served by achievement . . . <br>
          <br>
          ...he understood that he would inevitably be viewed as a provincial,
          and that it paid to play the clown a little . . .The metropolis, while
          it mistrusts an upstart, forgives a lovable provincial eccentric.<br>
          <br>
          Franklin liked to write letters claiming to be from other people .
          . . in order to dramatize some political point through obvious overload.
          The last thing he wrote was a letter purportedly from a Muslim slaver
          . . . whose lust for slavery was intended to hold a mirror up to the
          American slaveholder's own, and shame him.<br>
          <br>
          Franklin was an instictive ironist . . . it was his natural mode .
          . . the whole thing depended on being reported with an absolutely straight
          face. It was not that he did not value honesty . . . He would have
          beem reluctant to to say something that he believed to be a lie. But,
          as a businessman and a writer and a diplomat, he might very well be
          willing to dramatize, or even overdramatize, something he believed
          to be essentially the truth.<br>
          <br>
          Franklin's essentially ironic, distancing turn of mind . . . gave him
          a kind of second sight into the minds of his hosts. There is little
          sham in French life, but a lot of show, a lot of rhetorical gesturing.
          Franklin understood this style instantly. He was pretending to be a
          naif . . ., which the French knew to be faux, and they were pretending
          to be worldly, which he knew to be an illusion.<br>
          <br>
          But the logic of power depends largely on the perceptions, the feelings,
          of the people who have it. Franklin understood that, above all, the
          good opinion of the French mattered. It paid to be liked and admired,
          and he made sure that he was. He knew that he could not make his country,
          and its needs, inescapable if he did not make himself, and his cause,
          irresistable.<br>
