                <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Jastrow 
                  was a small, old market town surrounded by several villages. 
                  Farmers would drive in to sell their fresh eggs and fresh butter, 
                  live chickens, and in the fall, apples and pears by the sackful 
                  as well as potatoes by the wagonload. They and their wives would 
                  drive in on Tuesdays or Fridays, the designated market days, 
                  and park their horse-drawn wagons on a wide street running through 
                  the center of town. That is where my father had his dry goods 
                  store and that is where I was born. Berliner Strasse 1.<br>
                  <br>
                  The house belonged to my mother, the business to my father. 
                  It was a dowry arrangement, Grandfather Joseph Neuman did not 
                  seem to have trusted my father, &quot;a city slicker&quot; from 
                  Berlin. Grandfather had made his money in America's Wild West 
                  trading with Indians and supplying gold miners during the 1840's 
                  (he was born in 1821). Mother told stories of his being taken 
                  captive by Indians. Eventually, he returned to Thorn in what 
                  was then Germany, where he assumed the no doubt well-deserved 
                  life of a rentier. He died in Thorn around 1906 and is buried 
                  there in a family plot surrounded by a cast iron fence. I remember 
                  it well from one of the annual journeys Mother would make for 
                  arranging for the maintenance of the graves. This gives a suggestion 
                  of my mother's background.<br>
                  <br>
                  Regarding my father's background, he was born at Lauenburg in 
                  1878 to Emil and Rosa Aron nee Michaelis who operated a small 
                  dry goods store. There were three other children: Onkel Arnold, 
                  Onkel Leo and Tante Selma. Onkel Leo became a grain dealer in 
                  Ruegenwalde, a town on the Baltic Sea. Onkel Arnold seems to 
                  have pretty much disappeared until my brother Erwin ran into 
                  him in a concentration camp.<br>
                  <br>
                  And then there was Tante Selma. She and her widowed mother had 
                  moved to Jastrow in around 1915 after having sold their business 
                  for 11 thousand Thaler and used the proceeds to make a Kriegsanleike 
                  (buy War Bonds).<br>
                  <br>
                  My mother's mother, Minna Neuman (nee Dunn) was also now living 
                  in Jastrow. She, like many other Germans had fled after Thorn 
                  had become Polish. She had sold her property for a pittance 
                  and to add insult to injury, was soon to be paid off in worthless 
                  money during the soon to follosw inflation. For as long as I 
                  can remember, &quot;Grandmother Thorn&quot;, as we called her 
                  lived in a one room flat around the corner from us. She died 
                  there at the age of 75 shortly after Hitler came to power. There 
                  were two other relatives living in Jastrow. They were Gerda 
                  and Joseph Neumann, the children of my Mother's only full brother 
                  Siegfried although, unbeknown to me, Mother had had a half brother 
                  who was an sapothecary living in Koenigsberg. Siegfried, for 
                  whom I was named, was killed in the First World War. Gerda eventually 
                  married an American engineer by the name of Levy and was consequently 
                  able to save her brother, Joseph and her mother, Dorah. This 
                  then constitutes my extended family in my hometown. <br>
                  <br>
                  My immediate family consisted of my father, Alw in Aron, born 
                  in 1878 at Lauenburg and my mother, Amalie born in 1888 at Thorn. 
                  All of us children were born at home. My brother, Erwin in 1909 
                  and my sisters Ruth in 1911, Edith in 1913, Lissy in 1920 and 
                  me, in 1923.<br>
                  <br>
                  During World War I, Ruth unfortunately developed polio and would 
                  never walk again despite Mother's frantic and persistent efforts. 
                  She immediately took Ruth to the eminent professor Sauerbruch 
                  in Berlin who, of course, could not help her. In subsequent 
                  years Mother took Ruth for operations at the prominent clinics 
                  in Danzig, Gottingen and Rotterdam.. Ruth and my parents, as 
                  well as Tante Selma perished in the Holocaust. <br>
                  <br>
                  Tante Selma was a lovely person. I often think of her fondly 
                  and of the delicious fish she would prepare on occasion.<br>
                  <br>
                  I never knew Erwin well. In my youth, he was the mysterious 
                  person who would show up every now and then during school breaks 
                  from a private school at Schneidemuhl and, later, in between 
                  terms of the University of Breslau where he was studying chemistry. 
                  He later immigrated to the United States with wife, Lydia whom 
                  he had met and married in Breslau and their small son, Bernard. 
                  Irwin died in New Jersey in 1988 at the age of 79.<br>
                  <br>
                  My sister Lissy has her own story to tell but she won't, except 
                  for isolated and, in retrospect, sometimes amusing incidents. 
                  She was on her way to England where she had secured a position 
                  as a domestic when the start of the war left her stranded in 
                  Holland. When the German army overan Holland, Lissy - aided 
                  by the underground - went into hiding at one point, and remained 
                  in hiding until the end of the war. Jews in Holland had been 
                  required for some time to wear the yellow Star of David and, 
                  as she tells it, when the order came for Jews to report to designated 
                  places, she removed the permanently attached star from her sleeve, 
                  and loosely tacked it back on. She bought the ticket for the 
                  ordered destination and, also one for a station in-between.<br>
                  <br>
                  At the appointed hour, she boarded the crowded train. When it 
                  made its stop at the in-between station, she quickly tore off 
                  the star, got off the train, handed the correct ticket to the 
                  ticket agent at the gate - as was required - and was never to 
                  be heard of or seen again by the Germans&#133;&#133;&#133;well, 
                  perhaps not quite.<br>
                  <br>
                  There are two encounters especially, she sometimes recounts. 
                  On those occasions the expression on her face and the sound 
                  of her voice betray the anxiety she had felt at those terrifying 
                  moments almost sixty years earlier. At the same time a gleeful 
                  expression would creep over her face joined by an uncomfortable 
                  laughter evincing perhaps also a little pride in her cunning, 
                  for as she was telling the stories, she already knew their outcome: 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  On one occasion, perhaps six months before the war in Europe 
                  ended, Lissy was alone at an isolated country home owned by 
                  a Dutch woman who was hiding her at the risk of her own life. 
                  The &quot;underground&quot; had promulgated the information 
                  that the Germans were still searching for students and Jews. 
                  On that day, Lissy suddenly noticed a German soldier approaching 
                  the house.<br>
                  <br>
                  With the instinct of a longtime fugitive, she quickly put a 
                  bandana around her head, grabbed a broom all the while thinking, 
                  &quot;what language shall I speak? German would give me away, 
                  my broken Dutch would give me away&#133;.&quot; But, when moments 
                  later, the terrifying knock came at the door, nineteen-year-old 
                  Lissy was ready. In broken German, she asked the young soldier 
                  standing before her, &quot;What can I do for you?&quot; all 
                  the while wearing a friendly smile. &quot;Are there any Jews 
                  or students in this house?&quot; he asked. &quot;No&quot;, she 
                  replied, &quot;there is just me&quot;.<br>
                  At that, the soldier returned her smile and turned away, no 
                  doubt pleased at not having had to face the seemingly all pervasive 
                  hostility that the long years of oppression in Holland had brought 
                  on.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> A second 
                  incident occurred some time later which appears to have left 
                  a profound imprint on my sister and potentially could have cost 
                  her life as well as that of the heroic Dutch lady. The two of 
                  them were at this same lonely country home where, by now, the 
                  incessant thunder of American gunfire could be heard in the 
                  distance. Suddenly, a very drunken German major and his aide 
                  appeared. &quot;We shall protect you!&quot; the major blustered.<br>
                  <br>
                  A little while later, as they were leaving, and the major out 
                  of earshot, the aide turned to Lissy and said, &quot;Euch ist 
                  es schlimm gegangen aber jetzt kriegen wirs&quot; (&quot;You 
                  have had hard times, but now it's our turn&quot;).</font></p>

                  lives with Lou Adler, her husband of many years, near their

                  in Denver, Colorado. </font></p>

                <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
                  last time I saw my sister Edith in Germany, was on the platform 
                  of the Anhalter Bahnhof in 1938. She and her husband, Herbert 
                  Haase, and their 2 year old son Wolfgang (later changed to William), 
                  were fleeing to Shanghai, China. Mother had come up from Jastrow, 
                  which was about 150 miles away to say goodbye. The conversation 
                  centered on the recent events that had precipitated this hasty 
                  departure.<br>
                  <br>
                  It appears that, in the general round up of Jewish men during 
                  Kristallnacht Herbert had found himself in a concentration camp 
                  standing in line next to his brother Sigi. The commandant had 
                  ordered the assembly to make an announcement. &quot;Those of 
                  you who are due to emigrate within the next few weeks step forward&quot;. 
                  Herbert grabbed his brother's hand and dragged him that critical 
                  step forward. This single step forward turned out to be their 
                  and their family's lifesaver. <br>
                  <br>
                  So far so good. The trouble was, that Herbert had lied. Despite 
                  the fact that he had a sound affidavit to emigrate to the U.S., 
                  his quota number was so high that he would have had to wait 
                  for many years and, Sigi had nothing at all!<br>
                  <br>
                  The perplexing situation that faced Herbert and his brother 
                  was, there was no country in the entire world that admitted 
                  the Jewish refugees - never mind how desperate their situation 
                  might be except Shanghai and, in Shanghai there was no way to 
                  make a living.<br>
                  <br>
                  All countries seem to have operated under their standard emigration 
                  procedures, admitting only regular immigrants. In the United 
                  States, for example, the requirements were flawless, Strong 
                  affidavits from sponsors in the U.S. guaranteeing the maintenance 
                  of the prospective immigrant were needed, plus, there was a 
                  strict quota system. So, it was Shanghai for the Haases.<br>
                  <br>
                  The city of Shanghai would eventually admit 25,000 refugees 
                  - in contrast to the country of Brazil admitting 25,000 regular 
                  Jewish immigrants, 9,000 were admitted by the entire continent 
                  of Australia, 8,000 into the country of Canada, and India admitted 
                  none at all. These are examples demonstrating the degree of 
                  compassion and help that we Jews could count on from the civilized 
                  world. <br>
                  <br>
                  From what I heard, the life in Shanghai was very hard for most 
                  refugees. The climate was awful, sanitary conditions often a 
                  disaster, at least in the eyes of civilized Europeans, and there 
                  was this intractable problem of how to make a living. Herbert 
                  had established a cigarette business - buying cartons of cigarettes 
                  from arriving refugees who needed cash and then selling those 
                  cigarettes singly, The modest income garnered from this together 
                  with an allowance from our cousin in America, Selma Melvoin 
                  and her generous husband, Charles, afforded the Haases a more 
                  bearable life especially as their good friend, Dr. Dittner, 
                  took care of their medical needs.<br>
                  <br>
                  After these difficult times in Shanghai, Herbert, Edith and 
                  young William settled in Chicago where William still lives with 
                  his wife, Joan, and near their married children, Linda Cohn 
                  and David Haase.<br>
                  <br>
                  Edith and Herbert lived to a ripe old age, speaking English 
                  with a pronounced accent and loving their wiener wuerstchen 
                  and potato salad to the end.</font></p>

                  we had lived for about twenty years in a small village nearby

                  A classroon at one end of the building had a separate entrance 
                  and I made that into a studio apartment to rent in order to 
                  supplement our income. One classroom became my studio and an 
                  eight feet wide, forty-foot long hallway served as a display/storage 
                  area for my sculpture. We made the remaining part of the building 
                  into our home. There we lived modestly but comfortably for almost 
                  twenty years until ever increasing shaking of my hands made 
                  welding for me first difficult, and finally impossible. As I 
                  relied heavily on welding in my work, this really spelled disaster.<br>
                  <br>
                  Also, (unbeknown to Geri) I had experienced the first hints 
                  of some eventual heart trouble.. For those reasons, combined 
                  with financial considerations and my lessening ability to maintain, 
                  largely by myself, an isolated home in the mountains, with a 
                  private water system, private sewer system and a steam heating 
                  system as well as wall furnaces - all of which needed attending 
                  to, it was time to move.<br>
                  <br>
                  We sold the old school house we had partially built with our 
                  own hands and hearts, and relocated to our present compact townhouse 
                  in the capitol of The Land of Enchantment - Santa Fe.<br>
                  <br>
                  Now, I intermittently make jewelry using silver and turquoise. 
                  Jewelry making is not new to me. In fact, that is how I met 
                  Geri. The year was 1953. It was my first time as an exhibitor 
                  at Chicago's Old Town Art Fair where I was to show my work for 
                  the next twenty years - first jewelry, and then sculpture and 
                  Hanukkah Menorahs.<br>
                  <br>
                  Geri's cousin had recently opened a small gift shop in one of 
                  Chicago's suburbs and the two of them had come to the fair to 
                  look for some jewelry for the shop. That is how we met and became 
                  friends. We were married three years later. By that time I was 
                  living in the back of a &quot;store front studio&quot; on the 
                  near north side of Chicago. After our marriage, we continued 
                  to live there for a time where, at night, we could hear Fred 
                  Comacho with his guitar serenading his customers. The patio 
                  of his restaurant, the Azteca, was only a few yards away behind 
                  a brick wall. <br>
                  <br>
                  Unfortunately, the landlord would not give us a lease to the 
                  store, and Geri, my anvil, as well as my acetylene bottles were 
                  demanding stability. And so we were moving, but Chicago's Near 
                  North Side was to remain our home until, in 1973, we moved to 
                  New Mexico to the old school house, which we had acquired five 
                  years earlier.<br>
                  <br>
                  My mother would have loved my way of life here in New Mexico 
                  since, in a way, it resembled the sojourn in America of her 
                  greatly adored father more than a century earlier. It seemed 
                  fate had chosen me to fulfill her dream. Yet, how different 
                  it might have turned out for me had it not been for the Nazis 
                  coming to power in 1933, at the height of the depression. I 
                  was ten years old at the time. Father was in financial trouble: 
                  the goods in the store had lost much of their value, customers 
                  defaulted on their debt - especially farmers whom father had 
                  the custom of carrying until harvest time. After the Nazis took 
                  over, gentiles did not have to honor their debts to Jews. Father 
                  attempted to collect through the courts in a couple of egregious 
                  cases but soon learned his lesson. <br>
                  <br>
                  From now on, a Jew simply could not win against a gentile in 
                  a German court, never mind what the circumstances might be. 
                  The Nazi machine had corrupted the courts. German Jews lost 
                  their court cases, the German people lost their courts. The 
                  Nazi's attack on German institutions and culture had begun. 
                  Soon the Reichstag would burn and with it German democracy. 
                  Soon the books would burn and with them, the Universities. And 
                  later, when at the Universities, being a good Nazi was given 
                  preference over who is an outstanding scholar, nobody cared 
                  any more.<br>
                  <br>
                  And so the once mighty German Theater of Max Reinhard went. 
                  The once mighty Bauhaus was in shambles, most of its eminent 
                  instructors had fled - some to America where they started design 
                  schools of their own or headed departments at prestigious American 
                  universities. Modern painters fled or were not allowed to work.<br>
                  <br>
                  By the time Germany mourned the death of Hindenburg, its president 
                  and victor of the battle of Tannenberg, it was all over. But, 
                  we didn't know it then.<br>
                  <br>
                  Father was more preoccupied with meeting his obligations, and 
                  the Brownshirt outside who was preventing customers from entering 
                  the store did not help matters.<br>
                  <br>
                  Empty stores don't need sales personal. Soon, Mr. Sochalski 
                  was gone followed by Mitzi Brown, Erna Lau, and Erna Runo. Only 
                  Lieschen, the apprentice stayed for a few more years until my 
                  parents sold the house and business and moved into a flat. I 
                  believe that almost the entire proceeds went to clear up father's 
                  debts. But, by that time, I was living in Berlin.<br>
                  <br>
                  After the transfer of power in 1933, it did not take very long 
                  until father's store was completely devoid of customers. Instead, 
                  I would occasionally see some other Jewish gentlemen talking 
                  to father. As may be expected, their subject was invariably 
                  politics.<br>
                  <br>
                  There were two camps. There were the optimists, &quot;Er wird 
                  den Winter nicht uberstehen&quot; (he is not going to survive 
                  the winter&quot;, and the pessimists &quot;Ich sehe schwartz&quot; 
                  (I foresee a bleak future). Father was the author of these prophetic 
                  lines, early on. He was ready to emigrate right HERE AND NOW!<br>
                  <br>
                  Mother's reaction to this extraordinary notion was, &quot;Wir 
                  muessen doch erst die Kinder erziehen&quot; (But first we have 
                  to educate the children). But by 1937, even Mother had come 
                  to the conclusion that these days a suitable education meant 
                  Learning a Trade and not going to University. Consequently, 
                  she had managed to make arrangements for me to attend a newly 
                  constituted trade school in Berlin sponsored by the Reichsvertretung. 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  During my two year training at the school, I lived at a hostel. 
                  Berlin, Rosenthaler Strasse 26 was the location of the hostel 
                  the Reichsvertretung had established for Jewish boys from the 
                  &quot;hinterland&quot; who attended either the ORT school or 
                  Holzmarkt Strasse School. 26 Rosenthaler Strasse was also the 
                  address of the Wertheim department store. In fact, the Wohnheim, 
                  which is what the hostel was called, occupied two apartments 
                  located on the second and third floors of an annex at the end 
                  of the building and faced the confluence of Rosenthaler, Gormann, 
                  Gibbs and Weinmeister Strassen. The Weinmeister Klause was located 
                  at this intersection. This tavern was very busy, especially 
                  on Friday evenings and helped, no doubt, to complete the education 
                  of a bunch of recent Bar Mitzvah boys from the countryside. 
                  So did the adjacent streets for that matter.<br>
                  <br>
                  But living at the hostel was also an education, 'though of a 
                  different sort. The Wohnheim was headed by Herr Schoenfeld and 
                  his wife. Their living quarters were on the second floor, adjacent 
                  to the kitchen. Mr. Schoenfeld was a corpulent gentleman of 
                  medium height. He had a jolly disposition but he brooked no 
                  nonsense.<br>
                  <br>
                  I believe he did the cooking for approximately forty boys. Eva, 
                  a young woman also from the hinterlands, assisted him for a 
                  while. She had her own room next to that of the Schoenfeld's. 
                  In addition, there was Mr. Lipska, the head counselor, who had 
                  two young assistants that came and went. I suspect emigration 
                  had a hand in the turnover. <br>
                  <br>
                  The eating facilities on the second floor served also as common 
                  rooms. On the third floor, we boys slept in triple-tiered bunk 
                  beds - nine boys to a room. My daily routine was to get up, 
                  wash up in the washroom at the end of the hall, past the two 
                  toilets and two showers. Then down the stairs for a quick bite 
                  to eat and then off - along the Weinmeister, Muenz, Memhard 
                  Strasse, across the Alexander Platz, along the Alexander Strasse 
                  to the Holzmarkt Strasse 55 where the school was located. Time 
                  of arrival: two minutes to seven, hopefully, and, after an eight-hour 
                  school day, directly back home and supper. I believe we had 
                  to be in bed at eight o'clock and lights out by eight-thirty.<br>
                  <br>
                  The uncertain conditions of the time seriously impacted on our 
                  daily routine to the extent that Mr. Schoenfeld, or someone, 
                  needed to know where we could be reached at all times. Even 
                  on weekends, to get a pass, we needed to fill out a slip telling 
                  where we intended to go and where we could be reached.<br>
                  <br>
                  This last provision was to play an important, perhaps critical 
                  roll on the day many of us abruptly left Berlin for England.</font></p>

                <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The purpose 
                  of the trade school was to prepare us, sons of merchants and 
                  professionals, for an uncertain future and make easier, as far 
                  as possible, our survival in any foreign land. And it worked!<br>
                  <br>
                  These are the instructors as I remember them after more than 
                  sixty years:<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Herr Ledermann</b> was a short man, balding with reddish 
                  blond hair, of what had remained, and buck teeth. He had the 
                  pale blue gray eyes one associates with his hair color and complexion. 
                  He may have been in his early fifties in 1937. I retained the 
                  impression that he had been a bachelor. Professionally, he had 
                  been an engineer with the prestigious firm of Ludwig Loewe, 
                  a precision machine manufacturer. I believe Mr. Ledermann had 
                  been with that firm for a great many years - perhaps thirty, 
                  when they kicked him out. He was now reduced to attempting to 
                  teach a bunch of unruly teenagers the rudiments of technical 
                  drawing, basic math - particularly trigonometry and simple equations 
                  and, some geometry. He tried, in addition, to demystify the 
                  arcane workings of the various machines upstairs and the acetylene 
                  generator in the adjacent welding room. He was teaching every 
                  Friday in what doubled as dining and classroom.<br>
                  <br>
                  This room accommodated simultaneously, all students, perhaps 
                  50. This room, together with the already mentioned welding installation, 
                  wash up facility and material storage area constituted the lower 
                  floor of our two-floor school.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Meister Schoenfeld</b> (not related to the hostelmaster) 
                  spoke with the dialect of someone that had been born and raised 
                  in Upper Selesia. He had lost part of one leg in a mine accident. 
                  Consequently he walked with a limp and used a cane. Other conspicuous 
                  features were a handsome mustache and a thinning hairline. He 
                  was of medium height and medium build, perhaps forty years of 
                  age with a young redheaded wife and two small children. The 
                  Schoenfelds lived just around the corner and every day the older 
                  boy or the mother or, all of them would bring the Meister's 
                  lunch. They were ostensibly a harmonious family. I remember 
                  the Meister fondly. He was a very decent and compassionate man 
                  who put up with a lot from us boys. Not that he did not have 
                  an occasional flare-up of temper - for good reason, no doubt. 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Seeing it now, we were a motley crew of difficult to manage 
                  teenagers. Some had a limited talent, others did not want to 
                  be there at all with a consequent lack of applying themselves 
                  and, of course, we had our share of &quot;Berlinergrosschnauzen 
                  and witzbolds&quot;. (big mouths and jokers) I remember - it 
                  may have been the very day I started at the school, I had been 
                  given the task of straightening some angle iron on a thick cast-iron 
                  table for that purpose, when Salo Doyle came over to me and 
                  took my hammer. &quot;Roll the hammer like this&quot;, he said, 
                  and made an exaggerated circular motion hitting a piece of angle 
                  iron. This I did, and a few moments later Salo had sidled up 
                  to the Meister, who had been near by, and said something to 
                  him that made the Meister look over to me approvingly and commented, 
                  &quot;That boy should work out well!&quot;. I was later told 
                  that what I had done was an exaggerated way the meister worked.<br>
                  <br>
                  But Meister Schoenfeld's job also had its gratifying aspects. 
                  I think he knew in his heart that many of us would later put 
                  to good use the skills he and the other instructors were teaching 
                  us. In fact he did not have long to wait for confirmation.<br>
                  <br>
                  In 1938, the German government rounded up all Jews it had classified 
                  as being Polish and then proceeded to push them over the border 
                  back into Poland. A student by the name of Walter Storozum was 
                  among them. A few weeks later as all of us students were lined 
                  up to get ready for our morning calisthenics, the Meister appeared 
                  with a paper in his hand. It was a letter from Walter. In it 
                  Walter explained that he, together with his entire family, had 
                  been forced into Poland that fateful day. He further explained 
                  that he had been able to obtain a job as a welder and was now 
                  supporting his entire family. Walter was then sixteen years 
                  of age. At this date, in 1999, Walter lives in the United States.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Mr. Grohmann </b>was tall, twenty-eight years old and proud. 
                  And he had a right to be; he was a tool and die maker, which 
                  is a very skilled trade, indeed, as I was to find out later. 
                  His contribution in our training was the emphasis on precision 
                  bench work, that is to say, accurate measuring, filing, drilling 
                  and layout. In addition, he instructed us in the use of various 
                  machines - the lathe, milling machine, shaper, etc. Also, it 
                  was he who would procure the needed materials from a scrap yard 
                  not too far away. I believe he was from Berlin.<br>

                  <b>Mr. Meirowitch</b> was a small man, perhaps in his late thirties. 
                  He was unassuming. I remember him for his instruction in operating 
                  the lathe. He was also from Berlin, I believe.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Mr. Mader</b> was of small stature, perhaps in his mid-thirties. 
                  His specialty was welding and he was magnificent at it. I remember 
                  him to be admirably patient with those of us who did not catch 
                  on easily, but his obvious characteristics were his imperturbability 
                  and quietness. I never heard him utter a harsh word to anyone. 
                  Add to this, an ever-present smile and an ever-present cigarette, 
                  and that's how I remember Mr. Mader. Mr. Mader was not Jewish.<br>
                  <br>
                  The original school plan called for a three-year training period 
                  but after only two years had elapsed, I took the opportunity 
                  that I was offered, to transfer to ORT. Berlin ORT was then 
                  intended to serve as a vehicle to escape from Germany in addition 
                  to its original basic purpose. That was in the late spring of 
                  1939. From that time on, until our sudden departure a few months 
                  later, I, like the other ORT boys who lived at the hostel took 
                  the S. Bahn (the elevated) to Siemens Strasse where ORT had 
                  its training facilities. <br>
                  <br>
                  I joined the &quot;Feinmechaniker&quot; (precision mechanic) 
                  department headed by Meister Adler who was assisted by Max Abraham, 
                  &quot;Maschienenbauer&quot; (one who makes and repairs precision 
                  machines). The training program at ORT appeared to me to be 
                  about the same as that of the other school. I do not recall 
                  any noteworthy occurances until that eventful and final day 
                  in Germany more than sixty years ago.<br>
                  <br>
                  That Saturday, or Sunday - I don't remember which - I had filled 
                  out the usual questionaire indicating where I could be reached 
                  and went to visit Tante Eva and Onkel Otto. While there, the 
                  word cames to hurry back to the hostel where, I was met by the 
                  feverish activity of boys quickly packing their suitcases. I 
                  was told we were to assemble at the school, and that we were 
                  leaving for England. <br>
                  <br>
                  I don't remember if we actually left that evening or the next, 
                  but I do recall that I, like other boys who did not live in 
                  Berlin with their parents, had no money to pay for the trip 
                  to England. Somehow though, Mr. Simon, the school's director, 
                  had managed to get the necessary funds together on extraordinarily 
                  short notice. At any rate, no one was left behind. The first 
                  transport was on its way!<br>
                  <br>
                  About a hundred of us boys and a half dozen instructors made 
                  our way to the Chalottenburg Terminus where, that evening, we 
                  boarded an already crowded train bound for Cologne. There was 
                  standing room only. I was standing next to soldiers in uniform 
                  who were probably reporting for duty. War was in the air. Day 
                  had turned into night when we arrived in Cologne, which is where 
                  we had to wait for a Dutch train. Cologne was also the place 
                  from where I mailed the postcard home saying goodbye. It was 
                  a postcard scribbled while standing on the train.<br>
                  <br>
                  After a while, the train that was to take us to Holland arrived, 
                  stopping at the border where there were a few tense minutes 
                  as custom inspectors made their way through the train. In the 
                  end, everything was ok and slowly we began moving again&#133;..and, 
                  in a minute or two, crossed the border into Holland. We were 
                  free! </font></p>

                <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I spent 
                  the next 8 years living in the north of England. During the 
                  war I worked as a toolmaker in a small toolroom which supplied 
                  jigs, dies, and fixtures to munitions and aircraft factories. 
                  Towards the end of December 1947 I boarded the Queen Elizabeth 
                  bound for the United States where my brother and two sisters 
                  were now living. The United States has been my home ever since.</font></p>
