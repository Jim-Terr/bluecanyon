            <p>She was airlifted from Alta Vista Regional Hospital to the Neuroscience Intensive Care Unit at UNMH immediately, but the damage suffered was &ldquo;inconsistent with life.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>Dana was surrounded in her final hours by her family and her dear friends, Robert Lopez, Linda Romero, Brenda Ortiz, and Lindy Lucero, who courageously assisted New Mexico Donor Services in realizing Dana&rsquo;s wish for maximum organ and tissue donation.</p>
            <p>Dana was a devoted daughter, loving mother, constant friend, and compassionate caregiver. Dana was preceded in death by her father, longtime Las Vegas physician Isaac Terr, and by her husband, Osamu Konno. She is survived by her mother, Mildred Terr of Las Vegas, daughter Rebecca Konno of Kansas City, Mo., son Toby Konno and his wife Michelle of Albuquerque, sisters Laurie Ascenzi and Nancy Terr and her husband Robert Behrendt of Albuquerque, brothers Lewis Terr and Jim Terr of Santa Fe, Venanzio Ascenzi, and close family friend, Robert Lopez.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Dana had a very special relationship with each of her nieces and nephews: Damon, Kelly, and Jeffrey Terr, Francesca Ascenzi, and Neal Behrendt. Dana included her aunt GG Michelson, cousin Barbara Michelson and cousins Julie and Robert Rosen in her immediate family.</p>
            <p>Dana&rsquo;s classmates remember her from Mora Avenue Elementary, Castle Jr. High, and Robertson High School, where she was involved in numerous academic and musical activities.&nbsp;Dana earned her nursing degree from Luna and her B.S. from UNM/ Highlands.&nbsp;She was a nurse in Las Vegas, N.M. at Northeastern / Alta Vista for 25 years and also taught at Luna Vo-Tech.&nbsp; Dana was a consummate professional in her career, caring and skilled, and a leader in health education and policy.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Many of her patients are so grateful for the care she provided; they trusted her, were confident in her abilities and relied on her commitment to excellence. She made a real difference in the lives of her patients and their families.</p>
            <p>Dana had a big project lined up for herself &mdash; living her life. She was bold, adventurous, curious, artistic, seemingly fearless, ready for lifelong learning, new travel experiences, and trying new endeavors.&nbsp; Dana&rsquo;s straightforward, unique style and heads-on approach to life created her persona and endeared her to her friends. Dana was optimistic about the new year, having volunteered vigorously for Obama all fall.</p>
            <p>Dana loved gardening, in all its forms, and nature and beauty in general. She took immense pride in every bud and blossom in her garden, every rock and stem in her yard. She carried this nurturing quality into her profession and relationships, always encouraging others to develop their finest qualities, improve their lives, and cultivate healthy habits. Dana took pride in the &ldquo;walking club&rdquo; she started while working as a nurse in Roy, N.M., and she was always ready to support someone in taking the first step, be it mentoring new nurses or teaching cooking or in any number of projects. Setting an example by going from a swimmer to an accomplished marathoner,&nbsp;she showed people how to &ldquo;reinvent&rsquo; themselves before Oprah made that a household word.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Above all, Dana cultivated and carefully tended her friendships. She devoted herself to building, strengthening, and sustaining her relationships with her friends. She showed true Taurus loyalty, and was proud of the friendships she maintained throughout her life.&nbsp;She cherished each and every person in her wide circle of friends.</p>
            <p>Dana truly loved Las Vegas, from the steamy Montezuma hot springs to the Polar Bear Plunge in Storrie Lake and an occasional run up Gallinas Canyon. Dana touched many people in the community through her work and generosity and left a legacy of friendship and kindness.&nbsp;We all know Dana in different ways, through her many roles and relationships with us. Dana had such an incredible presence that we will all miss her and feel her absence keenly.</p>
            <p>A memorial service is planned for 11 a.m. Monday, Jan. 19 at the United Methodist Church at 8th and National in Las Vegas.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The family requests that in lieu of flowers donations be made&nbsp; in Dana&rsquo;s name &nbsp;to Doctors Without Borders (<a href="http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/" title="www.DoctorsWithoutBorders.org">www.DoctorsWithoutBorders.org</a>) or to the <a href="http://bluecanyonproductions.com/Vtreasurehunt/Donate-Enter.html">Dana Konno Scholarship Fund</a> (or directly at Luna Community College, Las Vegas, NM)..., which will provide nursing scholarships.</p>
            <p>May her memory be for a blessing.</p>

          <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LAS VEGAS OPTIC</strong><strong> </strong>Tuesday, July 8, 2014 at 5:33  pm&nbsp;<br />
          <br />
        Several  gifts have been offered by local merchants and others &shy;&mdash; and more are being  sought &mdash; as prizes to be found in a &ldquo;Treasure Hunt&rdquo; Sunday morning, Aug. 3, a  benefit for the Dana Konno Nursing Scholarship Fund at Luna Community College.<br />
      Clues  to gift locations around town will be given in a video to be posted on YouTube  early that morning.<br />
      <br />
      Video  producer Jim Terr, whose videos on YouTube recently topped one million views,  has announced the Vegas Treasure Hunt, with early prize offerings totaling more  than $800 in value. Prizes listed as of Tuesday [July 1] on the event  website,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.vegastreasurehunt.org/" title="www.VegasTreasureHunt.org"><strong>www.VegasTreasureHunt.org</strong></a>., include a one-night stay at the Plaza Hotel, four dinners  for two at Charlie&rsquo;s Caf&eacute;, handmade jewelry by Sarah Frazier and Tito Chavez,  book downloads, and a bottle of 1984 Alexander Valley Cabernet Sauvignon valued  at up to $500.<br />
      <br />
      The  treasure hunt video will also serve to promote Las Vegas&rsquo; scenery, architecture  and history, as have many of Terr&rsquo;s previous videos.<br />
      <br />
      All  event money donations will go to the nursing scholarship fund at Luna Community  College, which has so far given more than $11,000 to nursing students in need,  according to nursing program director Conni Reichert, RN, on the event website.<br />
      <br />
      Terr,  brother of the late nurse Danna Konno for whom the fund is named, said he hopes  the treasure hunt event proceeds will top the $11,450 previously distributed by  the nursing fund to nursing students with emergency needs.<br />
      <br />
      Dr. Joseph Whiteman said on the website, &ldquo;Of anyone in our society, nursing students  deserve our support. They are headed to a life of contribution to others and  form the bedrock of community. A few hundred dollars at the right time can have  a huge impact.&rdquo;<br />
      <br />
    Potential  prize gift donors may submit their gifts via the website,<a href="http://www.vegastreasurehunt.org/" title="www.VegasTreasureHunt.org"><strong>www.VegasTreasureHunt.org</strong></a>.</p></td>
