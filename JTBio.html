            Canyon Productions serves primarily as a vehicle for various entertainment
            and media projects produced by Jim Terr, and the humanitarian   
               agenda underlying them. Terr is a New Mexico native who is an
              active letter-to-the-editor writer in local and national media,
              a singer-songwriter, video producer and author. <br>
            <br>
            <span class="style7">Jim Terr's work has aired on the <b>ABC, CBS,
            NBC/Mutual, Westwood One, BBC (British) and National Public Radio </b> networks, <b>Voice
            of America, </b>the <b> Larry

            <p class="style6"><span class="style7">"In his letters and articles,
                Jim Terr makes too much sense. In any other country he would
                have long since been locked up." <i>-
              Jonathan Alter, Senior Editor, Newsweek </i></span></p>
            <p class="style6">"Jim Terr's spirit shows through consistently in the essays, songs
              and other projects he creates. It's the droll, sardonic, 'cut the
              B.S.' outlook that is known around the world as 'American.' His
              tone is especially valuable in an election year." <i>- James Fallows </i></p>
