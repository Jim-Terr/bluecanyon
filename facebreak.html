              a week went by...didn't miss it.<br />

          <p>I don't know how I let facebook weedle itself into my existence; so   I certainly don't know how my existence and facebook became   intertwined.&nbsp;&nbsp; It seemed a way to connect with my friends,   acquaintances, fellow animal advocates and protectors, and political   activists.&nbsp;&nbsp; It became a way to republish articles from animal groups,   the New York Times editorials, Truthout, Common Dreams, Change.Org,   Politico and so on.&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;            It became a way to learn who was eating their   baloney sandwich with a margharita at noon.&nbsp; And a way of learning what   Mercury was doing in the past, current or even in a future&nbsp;retrograde.&nbsp;   How had I ever lived without this information!&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then and then and   then...I realized I was so busy reading, responding to&nbsp;and composing   facebook messages I had no time to eat my own baloney sandwich!&nbsp;&nbsp; So,   goodbye facebook.&nbsp; Hello baloney.&nbsp; Or, should I say, godbye   facebook goodbye baloney?<br />
