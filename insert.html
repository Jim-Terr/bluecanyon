		Feature film synopsis © 2008&nbsp; Jim Terr </font></font></p>
		<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
		<font face="Book Antiqua, serif">Al Fine is a 70-year-old widower, 
		furniture business retiree from New York, living alone in Rio Rancho, 
		New Mexico.*</font></p>
		<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
		<font face="Book Antiqua, serif">He spends his days watching TV – 
		wrestling, golf, car races, war documentaries – and occasionally 
		visiting casinos to break the boredom of watching TV. </font></p>
		<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
		<font face="Book Antiqua, serif">His daughter, Rhonda, a sweet but 
		aimless 20ish sometime college student, calls frequently to check in, 
		complain, ask for money, and express concern about his gambling and his 
		boring life and obvious attempts to distract himself (“From what?” he 
		always asks defensively). </font></p>
		<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
		<font face="Book Antiqua, serif">She also comes to stay now and then, 
		when a relationship blows up and she needs to hide out for a few days. 
		During which they spend their time arguing about whose life is more 
		pointless and, when they get sufficiently loaded, singing songs together 
		to Al’s guitar accompaniment.</font></p>
		<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
		<font face="Book Antiqua, serif">One day Al wins the Half-a-Million-Plus 
		jackpot at Big Risk Casino. Seeking a little continued excitement, Al 
		offers the casino, through his conservative, reluctant young attorney, a 
		proposition: Rather than the prize money, he’ll take a penthouse suite 
		in the casino’s hotel, including cable TV and full room service, <i>for 
		the rest of his life</i>. </font></p>
		<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
		<font face="Book Antiqua, serif">Since Al is a drinker and a smoker, 
		from a short-lived family, and <i>has been diagnosed with terminal 
		prostate cancer</i> – all of which he freely discloses -- the casino’s 
		attorneys, accountants and hired actuaries decide to take the deal. And 
		Al, after all, has got his investment income, and he can sell his home 
		for some additional spending money. </font></p>
		<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
		<font face="Book Antiqua, serif">So Al puts the house up for sale and 
		moves in to the casino penthouse apartment. His daughter is appalled at 
		the news, just on principle.</font></p>
		<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br />
		<font face="Book Antiqua, serif">With the greater proximity to the 
		gaming tables and slot machines (Al plays them all), his money outlay 
		increases, as do his boredom and frustration. </font></p>
		<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
		<font face="Book Antiqua, serif">Rhonda comes to visit, and is 
		suspicious of the hotel’s concierge, Star, a beautiful native American 
		back from a brief, unsuccessful acting career in L.A. Star is obviously 
		bright, sassy and charismatic, yet genuinely humble and good-hearted, 
		and cares about and enjoys Al as a person -- yet Rhonda instinctively 
		dislikes and mistrusts her.</font></p>
		<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
		<font face="Book Antiqua, serif">Al seems to treat his prostate cancer 
		with indifference. He refuses formal treatment – much to Rhonda’s 
		dismay, of course – and dabbles instead with non-traditional therapies: 
		diet, acupuncture, warm rocks, massage, which also serve Al’s ongoing 
		quest for physical / romantic contact, a quest which never seems to pan 
		out. Al’s ability to sabotage any romantic prospects seems almost 
		infinite, despite his wit, financial security, and penthouse suite.</font></p>
		<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
		<font face="Book Antiqua, serif">One day when Star visits Al, she finds 
		him singing and playing guitar. She urges him to continue and, charmed, 
		pushes him to perform at the casino’s talent night. He’s clearly 
		conflicted about his aborted early career as a performer, but he works 
		through it in order to please Star. She and the audience love his 
		performance at talent night.</font></p>
		<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
		<font face="Book Antiqua, serif">On Rhonda’s next visit, Al works out a 
		couple songs with her, and they perform at the next talent night, to a 
		great reception, and the casino’s management offers them a trial gig in 
		one of the casino’s smaller showrooms. </font></p>
		<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
		<font face="Book Antiqua, serif">That gig goes over great. Star’s 
		boyfriend, a somewhat irritating non-native “promoter” of whatever 
		currently has him excited, offers to promote Al and Rhonda in other 
		venues. Subject to his continued good health, of course, and, we 
		suspect, partly in an attempt to please Star.</font></p>
		<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
		<font face="Book Antiqua, serif">Another woman enters: Sadie Blackwell, 
		50ish, sexy Santa Fe divorcee in stylish cowgirl attire. She seems to 
		have her own money, but she’s not real genuine or endearing, and so her 
		motives and attraction to Al are unclear and suspect, especially to Star 
		and Rhonda, who have gotten friendlier with each other.</font></p>
		<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
		<font face="Book Antiqua, serif">Despite occasionally ridiculing Sadie 
		behind her back, Al is spending more and more time with her, evidently 
		getting the sex he’s been missing for years, and buying her expensive 
		gifts though she doesn’t “need” them. His budding performing career is 
		on hold. Al notes that ejaculation is supposedly good for the prostate. </font></p>
		<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
		<font face="Book Antiqua, serif">He even wins almost $100,000.00 more 
		one morning in the casino – which he splits between Rhonda and Sadie 
		(Star refusing her offered “cut” on ethical grounds.)</font></p>
		<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
		<font face="Book Antiqua, serif">Suddenly (wouldn’t you know it?) his 
		prostate cancer worsens, he’s feeling general symptoms of tiredness, 
		etc., and he agrees to treatment. Reluctant to submit to a 
		prostatectomy, which will curtail his budding sex life, he opts for the 
		middle road, brachytherapy (insertion of small radioactive pellets). 
		Sadie has virtually disappeared. </font></p>
		<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
		<font face="Book Antiqua, serif">During his treatment and wait-and-see 
		period in his suite, Al and Rhonda discover and share with each other 
		some of their anger and early disappointments, and their mutual 
		“resentment” of mother/wife having died and left them years ago, and 
		they find forgiveness and release through some uncomfortable effort -- 
		and through music. </font></p>
		<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
		<font face="Book Antiqua, serif">Al’s condition and prognosis are left 
		undetermined, but we have a sense of Al and Rhonda having reached a 
		level of peace, clarity, love and honesty unimaginable earlier – and of 
		this being enough. </font></p>
		<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
		<font face="Book Antiqua, serif">(And isn’t this, after all, where we 
		all hope to end up?)</font></p>
		<p align="center" class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
		<font face="Book Antiqua, serif">-- End --</font></p>
		<p class="auto-style6" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
		<font face="Book Antiqua, serif">* (AL: Think Alan Arkin). Al’s favorite story, which no one 
		around here ever gets: “A family, </font>
		<font color="#000000" face="Book Antiqua, serif">
		<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><span lang="en-US">OK</span></font></font><font face="Book Antiqua, serif">,
